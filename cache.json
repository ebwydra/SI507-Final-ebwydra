Whereupon Rice claimed a share of booty under the maritime law. On the trial it appeared, that although Rice was in sight at the time of the action, yet from the peculiarity of his situation, it was impossible he should have contributed to the capture by terrifying the enemy: and so the jury found a special verdict in these words: \u201cThat captain John Rice was in sight, and at the distance of five or six miles at the time of the said capture, mentioned, and so forth; but that he did not contribute to the said capture, or influence her surrender to the said captain Taylor. And if upon this finding, &c. &c.\u201d The fact was, that Rice lay within a bar, close upon the shore of New-Jersey, and saw Taylor engage a British vessel about five or six miles out at sea. There were also two British vessels of force between Rice and Taylor, at the time of the action. Rice, observing the battle, saw at last one of the vessels strike to the other, but could not clearly discern which had the victory: believing that Taylor had surrendered, he reported in Jersey that poor Taylor was taken at last. But he found a few days afterwards, that Taylor had been successful, and brought his- prize safe into port. Whereupon he claimed a share of the booty under the general law respecting vessels in sight of a capture.\nIn the argument on the special verdict, the counsel for Rice rested his claim principally on Moll, de J. Mar. bk. 1, c. 2, g 20, urging that no testimony should be admitted against a presumption of law'.\nBut the judge observed, that the presumption of law is founded on a material fact: to wit, that the vessel in sight be armed and prepared for battle, or at least in a possible condition to join in the battle. When this is the case, the law will presume that her presence terrified the enemy and influenced the surrender; and therefore, although she does not join in the engagement, allows her a share of the prize in proportion to her men and guns. But if a vessel in sight is aground on a shoal or bar, or is far to leeward, with disabled masts and rigging, or is so situated (as in the present case) that it is manifestly impossible for her to take any part in the battle, she cannot be considered as to be so prepared for battle as to bring her within the presumption of law. \u201cWhen the reason of the law ceases, the law itself ought likewise to cease with it.\u201d 1 Bl.

Hainey] was sent in with one of her prizes, and soon afterwards fell sick. During the cruize the Rising Sun game into port to refit. Being at Philadelphia, a great part of the crew left her; whereupon the captain (or owners) published, an advertisement, calling upon the officers,\" seamen, and mariners, belonging to the Rising Sun, to repair on board by a certain day, in order to complete the cruize. One third of the crew, however, neglecting to appear, the owners and officers agreed to break up the cruize, opened a new rendezvous, and enlisted a crew under a new set of articles. The ship sailed on this second cruize, the four months of the first having not yet expired. Soon after her last sailing she captured the Tristram Shandy, and the Dimsdale, both which were condemned as prize. It appeared in testimony, that the Tristram Shandy was taken before the expiration of the first cruize, and the Dimsdale some days after. The libellant did not appear on the day advertised, neither did he sign the second set of articles, being sick at the time. As this cause touches a general doctrine, viz. how far owners are justifiable in breaking up a cruize, without the consent of all concerned, it wears a face of considerable importance. I have attended to it in this view, and am of opinion, that shipping articles form a contract between the owners on the one part, and the officers and crew on the other, and are for the,period specified, in full force with respect to the contracting parties. And this contract is not made with the officers and crew as an aggregate body, but with each mariner individually. Upon this ground. I think the contract cannot be totally dissolved (as hath been contended) by the will of any majority on either side, however great. If a single mariner withholds his consent, and the cruize is broke up by the rest of the concerned, and a new cruize commenced, as in the present case, this must be done, subject to the legal claim of the unconsenting mariner, of wages or prize money that may accrue during the term of the first cruize for which he con-traeted. If it were otherwise, if owners could for their own convenience, or from an apparent or real necessity, break up a cruize, those of the crew who may be languishing in captivity, or may be confined on shore by wounds or sickness incurred in the service of the ship, or otherwise, might be excluded from the advantages of a period of time for which they had engaged to run all hazards, and of which they may as yet have only experienced the misfortunes.\nJUDGMENT \u2014 That the libellant have a landsman\u2019s share of the prize brig Tristram Shandy, and that the bill be dismissed with respect to a share of the Dimsdale.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Admiralty Court, Pennsylvania.\nHAINEY v.

The HANNAH, ETC."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "[This was a suit by Clinton against the brig Hannah, and the ship General Knox.]\nA plea to the jurisdiction of the court was filed in this cause; and the question was, whether a shipwright might sue in the admiralty for his contract wages for building a ship or vessel designed for navigation on the high seas? After long argument, the judge gave his opinion as follows. The authorities which the libellants have urged in favour of the jurisdiction of this court, in the present case, are Croke, 290, and 1 Rolle, 533. All the other authorities adduced having reference to those, except one in 1 Strange, 707. In the first edition of Croke, 206, we find resolutions upon cases of admiralty jurisdiction subscribed by all the judges of both benches, in April, 1632; wherein, amongst other things, it is resolved that a shipwright may sue in the admiralty, provided his suit be against the ship. Rolle, as a. faithful abridger, gives the law as it then stood under the \u00abauthority of these resolutions. In article 19, he mentions the doctrine respecting shipwrights, and cites the case of Tasker v. Gale. And in article 21, he gives the law respecting charter-parties, adding these remarkable words: \u201cAs it was declared by the court to have been lately resolved by all the judges of England.\u201d So that those resolutions seem to be the only foundation upon which these doctrines rest. And it is very observable, that although Croke records the resolutions as they were subscribed in Hilary term, the eighth of Charles, yet he does not report the case'of Tasker v. Gale, although adjudged (according to Rolle) in the ninth of Charles, which must have been but a few months after. Neither hath any other reporter of that period noticed this case. From which it seems probable, that those resolutions, and the judgment in the case of Tasker v. Gale, were not admitted as good law even in that day.\nBut it is further observable, that when Sir Harbottle Grimestone published Croke\u2019s Reports in the year 1657, he prefixed, even to this first edition, a declaration under the title Mantissa, that the resolutions of the judges in February, 1632, were not of authority: and for this reason (according to Comyns) those resolutions were totally omitted in the subsequent editions of that work. Since that time no instance can be found in the books, where either these resolutions, or the ease of Tasker v. Gale adjudged thereupon, have been referred to either by the court, or in the pleadings in any adjudged case, except in the case of Woo ward v. Boni-than, Sir T. Raymond, p. 3: and there the court declared, that those resolutions had been denied by several judges, and renounced by even some of those who had subscribed them. And of this, Danvers also takes particular notice. Page 271. Therefore the authority of these resolutions seems to have been abolished by general consent. But another case has been referred to as authority in point, viz. 1 Strange, 707. The report is very short, and in these words: \u201cOn a motion for a prohibition, it was held, that a carpenter may sue for wages in the admiralty.\u201d This report, however, is too slight and solitary to authorize a decision contrary to general established rules. The word \u201ccarpenter\u201d doth not precisely indicate a shipwright, but may be applicable to a mariner on board a vessel; and as the cases referred to in the margin of this report, respecting the officers of a ship who sued in the admiralty as mariners, the probability is, that this also was an officer called the \u201cship\u2019s carpenter:\u201d a doubt having arisen whether the subordinate officers of a ship, as well as the master, were not prohibited from suing in the admiralty for wages. If the resolutions of the judges in 1632, and the decision in the case of Tasker v. Gale, were admitted as law, and if the carpenter mentioned in 1 Strange, 707, was the shipwright or builder, how is it possible that the judges so lately as the year 1705, should declare in court, that no instance could be found where both the contract and service were to be done on land, within the body of a county, that the common law courts ever permitted the admiralty to have jurisdiction? I refer to 2 Wils. 265: and this opinion was given in the case of a pilot suing for services done, indeed within the body of a county, but in a case of a much stronger maritime complexion than the present.\nThere are several exceptions to the general rules of law respecting admiralty jurisdiction, as ascertained by the statutes: such as suits for mariners\u2019 wages, and on hypothe-cations made by the master in foreign parts, &c. &c. which have been so often contested, and so often allowed, for good and weighty reasons, that they have become confirmed law, and it would be in vain now to oppose the general rule to the generai practice. But this does not appear to be the case with respect to shipwrights; neither are the same reasons applicable to them. Their contract is made with persons whom they \u2022 know, or ought to know; their services are all executed within the body df the county, and mostly on dry land above high water mark; their wages have no reference to a voyage performed, or to be performed; the shipwrights have no interest or concern whatever in the vessel after she is on float, and the merchant hath paid for her; and lastly. the practice of former times doth not justify the admiralty\u2019s taking cognizance of their suits.

The LETHE."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "HOPKINSON, J.\nThomas Shaw, the libel-lant, entered on board the ship Lethe, as surgeon, and'contracted to serve in that capacity from Philadelphia to Bourdeaux, and back again, for the wages of \u00a315 per month. It was then war, and so continued till the vessel arrived at Bourdeatix: whilst she was there in port, peace took place. The libel-lant continued on board, and returned with the vessel to Philadelphia, and now demands the stipulated wages of \u00a315 per month, notwithstanding the peace. Much has been said respecting the entirety of contracts on the one hand, and the divisibility of contracts, particularly those of insurance and mercantile agreements, on the other.\n' It has been urged for the libellant, that the voyage to Bourdeaux and back again, must be considered as one entire voyage; and that if this vessel had been insured, or chartered, there could have been no apportionment of the premium or hire on account of the peace. Against this doctrine, the case of Stevenson v. Snow, 3 Burrows, 1237, has been cited, and fully considered. The case was \u2014 a ship was insured for a certain premium, to sail from London to Halifax; the insured warranting that she should sail with convoy from Portsmouth. She arrived at Portsmouth, but the convoy was gone. Whereupon a return of premium was demanded, deducting only the customary insurance from London to Portsmouth. The entirety of contracts was here urged against the insurers, but over-ruled by the whole court, who considered the contract as divisible, and having reference to two distinct voyages, viz. from London to Portsmouth, and from thence to Halifax; and determined that as the risk of the second voyage had never been begun, the premium for that had never inured. This case appeared at first view to apply closely to the present; but, on a nearer inspection, I find that the warranty to sail with convoy was the ground of that decision. It was that alone which rendered the voyage divisible, because it was of'the essence of the contract. , Had the ship sailed without, and been lost, the insurers would not have been answerable. Had she been insured from London to Halifax, without any condition annexed, and had stopped on her way at Portsmouth, and proceeded no further, the voyage would not, I apprehend, .have been deemed divisible on that account, nor the premium apportioned; so that the warranty to sail with convoy was the foundation of the contract, which failing, the contract failed, so far as the same had respect thereto. The voyage from London to Portsmouth seems to be no more than a necessary passage to the place where the substantial part of the contract was to take effect; where the premium was to be earned by the commencement of the risk under the condition specified. But I find nothing parallel with this in the articles of the ship Lethe: no contingency mentioned; but only a simple contract for a voyage to Bourdeaux and back again, in consideration of certain services to be performed on the one part, and certain wages to be paid on | the other. If there is any similarity in the : two cases it consists in this: that, as in the i one, the sailing with convoy was the ground of the quantum of the premium; so in the other, the war was the ground of the quantum of wages. In the case referred to, the contingency was fully recognized in the contract: the ship was warranted to sail with convoy, but no contingencies are provided for in the Lethe\u2019s articles. If the insured vessel had sailed with the convoy, though but for one day, and returned, it cannot be supposed that any part of the premium ' would have been restored. That the mere arrival of a vessel at a port or ports cannot be construed as a division of the voyage delineated by the articles, is manifest from a current of law and practice; so it was determined in the ease of Bermon v. Wood-bridge, Doug. 781, and numberless charter-parties, insurances, and articles for mariners\" wages have reference to circuitous voyages. Nor was it understood, that a fortuitous increase or diminution of the risk, or any alteration of circumstances between one port of destination and another, would affect the contract, unless provided for by the terms of the agreement. But it hath been strongly urged, that the high wages promised, and the nature of the service to be performed,, have reference to war only; and that as peace took place whilst the vesssel was safe in port, the' voyage, from -the manifest object of the contract, became divisible: and that it would be veiy hard to bind the master or owners to the most severe construction of the articles, and make them pay for services, which, from an unforeseen change of affaire, were rendered impracticable.\nAlthough there is an equitable force in this argument, yet, under the circumstances. of the case, there seems to have been an obvious duty on the part of the master to have entitled him to an equitable relief from the binding force of the articles. He should have proposed to pay off the crew at Bour-deaux, and tendered a new contract on peace establishment, protesting against the former articles. Nor is this a mere ceremony, but what substantial justice seems to require. The mariners, under the articles, could not leave the ship without incurring a penalty. If then they are detained on board without any explanation, notwithstanding the great change of circumstances, they had sufficient reason to conclude, that they were continued in the service upon the terms of the subsisting contract: and this reasoning will well apply if the case be reversed. Suppose the mariner had engaged in time of peace, and war had broke out during the voyage, and he had made no declaration that he was dissatisfied with the terms of his contract, or expected war wages in consideration of the risk he was to run, I believe there are few masters of vessels who would not urge his silence as an acquiescence in the continuation of the contract, and bind him down to the terms of the original contract. It is so natural to expect some declaration of the will of contracting parties, when circumstances out of the reach of either have occurred, which totally alters the principles upon which the contract was formed, thatan omission of such declaration can have no other interpretation, but that of wilful neglect or deep design, neither of which is the law disposed to. countenance. Hence, probably, arose the custom of protests, in cases of wreck, illegal capture, fire, and. other unforeseen and unavoidable accidents.\nOne other argument hath been urged for the respondents, viz. that freight is the mother of wages; inferring, that.as this vessel received only peace freight from Bour-deaux to Philadelphia, no more than peace wages ought to be allowed for that part of the voyage. It does not appear in testimony what freight this vessel received: but if it did, I see no force in the argument. There is, in fact, no connexion between freight and the quantum of wages; nor are the mariners ever privy to the terms on which a cargo hath been shipped. It is only a law of policy which arbitrarily makes the payment (not the rate per month) of the wages to depend on the safe conduct of the cargo, in order to induce the mariners to exert themselves in case of wreck, to save as much as possible, knowing, that if the whole be lost, they must lose the whole of their wages. If the freight is thus called the mother, the service performed may well be deemed the father, of the mariner\u2019s wages, that being the real and legal consideration. There is no doubt but the mariner shall have his wages, in cases where no freight at all is received; as in vessels sailing with ballast only, which often happens.. The truth is, the mariner\u2019s lien is on the ship, and not on the cargo. Nor was it ever known, that freight could be attached in the merchant\u2019s hands to answer for mariner\u2019s wages, but the ship is liable under all circumstances.\nI have not noticed the ship\u2019s going to Ten-eriffe from Bourdeaux before she came to Philadelphia, as this circumstance, if it has any operation at all, must be against the master, who ought not to benefit by his own deviation from the articles. \u25a0 \u2022\nAfter mature consideration, I cannot find sufficient reason to give a different decision now, from what was lately given In the case of M\u2019Culloch v. The Lethe- [Case No. 8,738]. The continuation' of the libellant on board,after it was known that peace had taken place, without any declaration of the master, that he expected the terms of the contract should be changed, is too strong a circumstance to be got over. But, as I think it a hard case, I would recommend an appeal; that the law and arguments may be again considered by another court.\nJudgment. \u2014 That the libellant receive wages agreeably to the contract; and that he pay one half, and the respondent the other half of the costs of suit.", "author": "HOPKINSON, J.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Admiralty Court, Pennsylvania.\n[Bee, 424.]\n1\nSHAW v.

Being on her voyage she was discovered, pursued, and captured by Josiah Crane, master of the brigantine Two Friends, belonging to subjects of the United Netherlands, and furnished with letters of marque and reprisal against the subjects of the king of Great Britain. Holland had not at this time entered into any treaty with, or acknowledged the independence of, the United States of America. Captain Crane took out part of the crew of the Susannah, and put a prizemaster on board, and ordered her for Philadelphia; but the Susannah was again captured during her voyage to Philadelphia by a British privateer, taken to New-York, and there condemned. The Two Friends arrived at Philadelphia, where Gibbs the owner of the Susannah libelled against her, and against Captain Crane for reparation of the loss and damage sustained.\nIn considering this case, two obvious points present, viz.: 1st Hath the brig Susannah so offended by her intended voyage to Turk\u2019s Islands as to afford probable cause of capture and confiscation? 2d. If not, who ought to satisfy the owner for the loss of his vessel and cargo?\nOn the first point the question occurs, whether Turk\u2019s Islands, may, or may not, be considered as property under the dominion of Great Britain? Whatever might have been the situation of these islands in the years 177S and 1779. it is evident that at present they are abandoned by every nation, there having been no officer who hath exercised civil or military powers there under the authority of any government whatever for at least these two years past If ihe British ever had legal dominion over these islands they have abandoned their right, and released the inhabitants from all allegiance by withdrawing all protection. So that those people may truly be said to be in a state of nature, unless they have formed some government of their own. What offence then can arise from trading with those islands? It is plain, from the clearances and entiles in our own naval offices, that this trade hath not been deemed unlawful: and it is also in evidence, that American, French, and Spanish vessels constantly go to these islands for salt, and nobody hath heretofore questioned the legality of this commerce. But it is said, that the variance between the office clearance and an invoice found on board, marking the real destination of the voyage, affords probable cause of capture, and even a sufficient ground for confiscation. I find, however, that it is not an unusual practice for merchante to clear out as for one legal port, but with a design of going to some other legal port, in order to conceal the real voyage, for mercantile purposes. Nor hath this practice ever been deemed an offence, or the papers found on board a vessel under such circumstances been considered as double papers, such as should induce a condemnation.\n\u25a0 The next question is, who ought to be answerable for the injury done? the captain, or his owners, or both? The relation between the owners and master of a vessel hath, to many purposes, been considered as that of master and servant; and the law is clear, that the master is bound by whatever the servant doth by his order, under his authority, or in the prosecution of his service. See [Vance v. Campbell] 1 Black [66 U. S.] 429. It has been contended, however, that Captain Crane was not in the prosecution of his owners\u2019 service, when he made this capture, the object of the voyage being merely mercantile, and not to take prizes. But as this vessel was duly commissioned to take prizes, and the owners and captain would have shared the produce of a legal capture, this distinction cannot be admitted, but the owners and captain must be considered as jointly answerable.

To say that a capture which is out of the fanction and protection of the rights of war, can nevertheless derive a validity from the rights of war, is surely a contradiction in terms. The rights of war can only take place among enemies, and therefore a capture can give no right, unless the property captured be the property of an enemy. But it is stated, that both Ship and Cargo, in the present cafe, were originally (that is antecedently to the British capture) in the predicament of neutral property: No property then was transferred by the capture, and of consequence the property in question was not upon the ground it has been considered\u2014British property. \"But, it is said, the fact cannot be ascertained, that the \u201ccapture in this cafe was not authorized by the rights of war\u2014\"for it depends upon the will of the fovereign, whether an outrage and capture, supra altum mare, by his subjects of te property of subjects of another nation, shall be an illegal and piratical act, or an act of hostility: That the sovereign is not obliged to promulge his will on the moment he makes \u201c war, and that as the human will, has no physical existence, it cannot be ascertained but by a declaration of it by the sovereign himself, and therefore non constat, but that the capture \u201c in the present case was authorized by the British crown, and \u201c so a fair act of hostility, authorized by the rights of war.\u201d\nThis argument is ingenious and plausible, but not solid. As the state of nature was a state of peace, and not a state of war, the natural state of nations is a state of peace and society, and hence it is a maxim of the law of nations, founded on every principle of reason, justice and morality, that one nation ought not to do an injury to another. As the natural state (that of nations) is a state of peace and benevolence, nations are morally bound to preserve it. Peace and friendship must always be presumed to subsist among nations; and therefore he who founds a claim upon the rights of war, must prove that the peace was broken by some national hostility,and war commenced but mere conjecture, supposition and possibility, can render no competent evidence of the fact. But it is said \u201chere was a national hostility\u2014viz. The capture by the British privateer; \" and the act of the subject is the act of the sovereign.\u201d\nThe act of the subject can never be the act of the sovereign unless the subject has been commissioned by the sovereign to do it: But, in this case, there is no evidence that the commission of the British privateer extended to property, under the circumstances of the property captured.\nBut it is asked \u201cwhat private or public mischief can be apprehended from considering property under the circumstances of this case as prize: For, the wrong was committed by the \" British privateer, and therefore the British nation is chargeable with it, and bound to make compensation.\u201d\nWe are inclined to think, that were the claimants to apply to the British crown for compensation, they would be told \u201cthat \" altho\u2019 satisfaction were done, yet it would be in proportion only to the wrong done by the British privateer, which consisted only in the seizure and detention. But if compensation was expected for ship and cargo, they must look to that nation for it, whose courts declared a condemnation, and whose subjects reaped the fruits of it.\u201d\naBut, \u2019tis 'alledged, that \u201c the late ordinance of Congress is express and decided, that after a capture and occupation for twenty-four hours the property captured shall be prize.\u201d\nThe ordinance of Congress certainly speaks of a legal capture; to admit a different construction would be a violence both to the terms and spirit, or intention, of it. Prize is generally used as a technical term to express a legal capture; and Congress having adopted it in framing of the ordinance, the general sense or acceptation of it must determine its import and signification. But suppose the term prize merely imported a capture, without any reference to its legality, and that it was the spirit and intention of the ordinance to subject to prize all captures, both legal and illegal, after twenty-four hours; it does not follow that it would affect the present case. The municipal laws of a country cannot change the law of nations, so as to bind the subjects of another nation; and by the law of nations a neutral subject, whose property has been illegally captured, may pursue and recover that property in whatever country it is found, unless a competent jurisdiction has adjudged it prize. The municipal laws of a country can only bind its own subjects.\naThe ordinance of Congress is in truth a new regulation of the jus post liminii, and limits it to a recapture within twenty-four hours, and therefore can only relate to the subjects of the United States: it adopts the ordinance of France, and that ordinance relates only to the subjects of France. In both cases, with regard to the owner, a subject, the property captured is not passed away before the expiration of twenty-four hours. But put the case of a capture and the sale of it before twenty-four hours to a neutral subject; the sale is certainly good and conclusive upon the owner; for the question must be decided by the law of nations, and by the law of nations, the property captured is transferred to the captor as soon as it is taken.\nBoth the ordinances therefore of Congress and of France, in our opinion, relate only to property captured from a subject and recaptured; and not to property captured from a neutral and recaptured. It is said, \u201cthat arguments drawn from the law of \u201cnations with regard to Pirates, do not apply to the present \u201ccase, because pirates have not the rights of war.\u201d\nIf the principal fact was properly attended to, the present case could not be questioned. Whence is it that pirates have not the rights of war? Is it not because they act without authority and commission from their sovereign? And is it not objected and proved, that the British privateer, with regard to the property captured, acted without commission and authority from the British crown? So far from there being any dissimilarity in the cases, it is in fact the very case in judgment, considering it on the first ground of argument.\nBut, it is alledged, \u201cthat the capture by the British privateer \u201cmust be considered as legal: For, after a capture and occupa-\u201ction for twenty-four hours, the legality of the capture is not \u201copen for question and examination.\u201d\nThis doctrine must never be suffered; there is no example or precedent for it to be found in any of our books; it breaks down and destroys the distinction between right and wrong; it gives a sanction to injuctice, robbery and piracy, and it is reprobated by the laws, usage and practice of nations. Lord Mansfield, in the case so often quoted, 2 Burr. 693, says, \u201cThe question, whether the property is transferred by the capture, can only \u201chappen between the owner and vendee, and between the \u201cowner and the recaptor.\u201d But the question could never happen between the owner and the recaptor, if the legality of the capture was not examinable on every libel for condemnation as prize. The question is\u2014Prize or no Prize? That is whether the capture be legal or not.\nThe legality of a capture is open for question and examination, till a competent jurisdiction has decided the question, and a decree passes for condemnation as prize; then, and not before, all further questions and examinations are precluded; then, all parties, and all foreign courts, are estopped to say, \u201cthe capture is not legal;\u201d and if the decree be erroneous or iniquitous, the party injured must apply for redress to that nation, whose courts have committed the error or iniquity.\n\u201cGreat difficulties, it is said, will arise, if capture and occu-\u201cpation for 24 hours should not be considered as conclusive evi-\u201cdence of property in the captor, and that the capture was le-\u201cgal.\u201d And it is asked \u201cmust a regular title be deduced from \u201cthe first proprietor to the captor, as in case of an ejectment at \u201cthe common law?\u201d And \u201c must common law strictness, in \u201cmaking out titles, be adopted in Admiralty courts?\u201d\nEvery libel states a title to the thing captured; the title must not only be stated, but it must also be proved. It is stated in the libel in this case, that the property captured was British property, the evidence to prove it is, \u201c possession and occupation of it by the British privateer.\"\nA title thus traced is a good one, in a court of common law, except in a single case: it is a good title against all the world except the right owner. This exception is founded on every principle of reason and justice; it ought not only to be adopted in courts of common law, but in every court, where the distinction between right and wrong is preserved, and justice regarded. Possession and occupation ought, upon a question of property, to have the same influence in courts of admiralty, as in courts of common law: it ought to be considered as a good title, and conclusive upon all mankind except the right owner. Such a title is clear of all difficulties in the proof of it; it excludes the necessity of a regular deduction of title from the first proprietor down to the captor; it is disengaged from those entanglements, which result from a variety of possible changes and mutations of the property; and it cannot be shook, but when every honest man will say it ought to be shook;\u2014when the right owner appears and proves his property. We have now done with the observations and reasoning, that relate to the first ground of argument: and are of opinion, that if the ship and cargo were originally neutral property, the capture and occupation for 24 hours did not change it into British property and make it prize.\nBut another ground has been taken to affect the cargo: The libellants say, \"that the cargo is the produce and growth of Dominica; that the said cargo is the property of British subjects of that Island; that therefore it was not neutral property, but British, and originally prize.\"\nTo this the claimants reply, \"that after the declaration of independence, and after the alliance of these States with France, the British Island of Dominica was taken by the arms of his most Christian Majesty; that before the reduction of it, articles of capitulation took place, by which the owners and possessors of estates in the Island were secured in the possession and enjoyment of them, and indulged with carrying on trade and commerce, upon an equal footing with subjects of France; that the said Island since the conquest has been under the protection and government of France; that before the failing of the ship a passport was obtained from the French Governor, requiring all commanders of French armed vessels, and all commanders of Spanish and American armed vessels, the allies of France, not to impede or obstruct the passage of said ship, the cargo on board being property of capitulants; that the said articles of capitulation bind America as the ally of France; that therefore the cargo, although the property of British subjects, yet it is British property protected from capture, by the articles of capitulation; and that it is in the predicament of neutral property, and therefore was not originally prize.\u201d\nUpon these facts and allegations two capital questions arise: 1st. Whether the cargo was British property, protected by the articles of capitulation against French and British captures?\n2d. Whether America, as the ally of France, is bound by the articles of capitulation?\nWith regard to the first question it is contended, on a variety of grounds, that this cargo is not protected from capture by the articles of capitulation.\n1st. Because the capitulation does not extend to property shipped and on passage at sea.\n2d. Because the owners were principally non-residents at the time of capitulation, and, therefore, although owning estates at Dominica, cannot be considered as capitulants.\n3d. Because the proceeds of this cargo were to be remitted from Holland to the owners residents in Great Britain.\n4th. Because the voyage was in fact calculated for Great Britain and for Amsterdam in Holland, and therein was a breach of the articles of capitulation, and a forfeiture of its protection.\n5th. Because the cargo on board was the property of British subjects not residents, nor owning estates, in Dominica, and therefore not within the protection of the capitulation.\nThe first, fourth, and fifth grounds, apply to the whole cargo, and the second and third to the principal part of it.\nWhether the articles of capitulation extend protection to property after shipped and on its passage at sea, depends on the 13th article, and the general tendency and scope of the capitulation itself.\nThe main design of the capitulants was, to obtain a perfect security for their estates and property; and a full exercise of all the rights of property and ownership; And one great, object with the French General was, to secure to France the commerce of the Island, and all its advantages, emoluments and revenues; but it was inconsistent with the design and object, which both had in view, to open to French and British capture the produce, of the Island, and property of the capitulants, as soon as a-float at sea.\nThis would have injured the rights of property, discouraged the labour and agriculture of the Island, lessened its exports, and diminished the revenues of its government.\nBut the thirteenth article seems decisive: it stipulates \"that \u201cthe Merchants and Inhabitants of this Island, included in the \u201cpresent capitulation, shall enjoy all the privileges of trade, and \u201con the same conditions as are granted to the subjects of his \u201cmost Christian Majesty, throughout the extent of his domi-\u201cnions.\u201d\nBy this article the capitulants are placed, with regard to their trade and commerce, on an equal footing with the subjects of France; every commercial privilege which the subjects of France enjoy is conceded to the capitulants; but it is certainly one privilege which a subject of France enjoys, that his property at sea, in the line of a fair trade and commerce, shall not be captured as prize by French subjects; consequently the cargo in this case, which is the property of capitulants, cannot be subject as prize to French captures. But is it asked, \"was it not subject to British capture\"? The article, it is said, stipulates, that the trade shall be carried on upon the like condition with the French trade, and the French trade is subject to interruption by British capture.\nHad the capitulation stipulated generally, that the capitulants should exercise all the rights and privileges of trade exercised by the subjects of France, the case would have been a clear one; the capitulation then might have been fairly considered as a compact between the French and British crowns, that a trade should have been carried on by the captulants, in the extent of the French trades, and consequently that neither crown could interrupt it by captures without a breach of faith: The difficulty arises upon the provision in the article, that the privileges of trade shall be considered upon the conditions of the French trade, which it is said implies, \u201cthat as the French trade is exposed to British captures, so must be the trade of the capitulants.\u201d\nIt is observable, that this article is propounded on the part of the capitulants, and the conditions stipulated must have been in their ideas productive of some benefit and advantage: Was it for the benefit and advantage of the capitulants, that their property so captured should become the property of the captors, and liable to confiscation? Certainly not.\nBut admit, that this article was propounded on the part of the French general; what beneficial object could he have in stipulating, that this trade should be exposed to British capture? Was it for the interest and advantage of the French crown, that this fresh accession to its commerce should be harassed and discouraged by British capture? Certainly not.\nA construction then so pointedly against the interest of both parties, can never be the right one: The truth is, the condition expressed in the article refers only to the duties, imposts and regulations of commerce.\nBut if the construction was admissible, that it was for the interest of the British capitulants, that this trade should be liable to such interruption by British captures, what must we think of the opinion of the eminent Lawyers of Great Britain which have been cited? They say, that this trade is protected by the capitulation against British captures: Deciding then against the contended interest of the capitulants, do not their opinions from such a circumstance acquire a great additional force? The British Crown by its proclamation gives incontestible evidence, that the property of the capitulants is not exposed to British capture; for it refers to the capitulation, asserts the protection it gives, and confirms it.\nWith regard then to the question, \"whether the capitulation extends protection to property, when shipped from the Is-\u201cland and afloat at sea?\u201d We are of opinion that it does.\nBut it is objected, on the second ground of argument, that the cargo was principally the property of residents in Great Britain at the time of the capitulation, and, therefore, although owning estates in the Island, yet not entitled to the benefit of the capitulation.\nIt will be proper in the consideration of this objection to attend to the 9th, 12th and 13th articles of capitulation.\nThe 9th article says: \u201cThe absent inhabitants, and such as \u201care in the service of Great Britain, shall be maintained in the \u201cpossession and enjoyment of their estates; which shall be ma-\u201cnaged for them by their attornies.\u201d\nThe 12th article says : \u201cThat widows and other inhabitants, \u201cwho, through illness, absence, or any other impediment, cannot \u201cimmediately sign the capitulation, shall have a limited time \u201cto accede to it.\"\nAnd the 13th article says : \u201cThe inhabitants and merchants of this Island included within the prefent capitulation, shall \u201cenjoy all the privileges,\u201d &c.\nThe fact is admitted, that the cargo is the produce and growth of Dominica, and that the principal part of it belongs to British subjects; possessing estates in the Island, but non-residents at the time of the capitulation\nIt is objected, \u201cthat with regard to such non-residents, the operation of the 9th article extends no farther than to protect the estates of such persons from seizure and confiscation, by the rights of conquest; that the 12th article extends only to those who have acceded to the capitulation within the time limited, and that the 13th article extends only to such inhabitants and merchants as are included at the time of capitulation, and not to non-residents.\nTo this it is replied, \u201cthat by the 12th article absentees may come in within a limited time and accede to the capitulation, and that then they fall within the description of the 13th article, which says, \u201cthe inhabitants and merchants of this island, \u201cincluded within the capitulation, &c.\u201d\nUpon these allegations and facts, two questions arise:\n1st. Whether the claimants who were non-residents and absentees at the time of capitulation have acceded to it?\n2d. Whether having acceded to it, they come within the description of the 13th article, and are entitled to the rights and privileges of trade there conceded?\nWe have carefully examined all the bills of lading and the depositions annexed, and find that the property mentioned in each bill is proved, by the respective depositions, to be the property of a British capitulant. Whether he personally, or by attorney representatively, subscribed the capitulation, does not appear; nor do we think it material, for the maxim is a true one, qui facit per alium, facit per se.\nIt is proved by the deposition of Mr. Fitzgerald, that in the general sense and opinion of the people of the Island, the subscription of an attorney for his principal was sufficient, and Mr. Fitzgerald mentions an instance, where a principal was refused by the French Governor the benefit of the capitulation, because his attorney had neglected to subscribe for him. He also proves, that it was the uniform and uninterrupted practice of the Island, for principals non-residents to subscribe by attorney; which would not have been the case, unless such mode had been agreeable to the spirit and intention of the capitulation.\nBut it is said, \u201cthat none could accede to this capitulation but such as were in a capacity to stipulate a neutrality, and that non-residents, in Great Britain, although owning estates in Dominica, could not consistently with their allegiance engage a neutrality of conduct.\u201d\nIt must be admitted, that where the supreme authority is competent to protect the rights of subjects, a subject cannot divest himself of the obligation of a citizen, and wantonly make a compact with the enemy of his country, stipulating a neutrality of conduct; but certainly he may enter into such an agreement, when it is no longer able to give him protection. In the present case, the British Crown was not able to secure to the owners their estates in Dominica, and therefore they had a natural right to make the best terms they could, for the preservation of their property; for, it is a general maxim of the law of nations, \u201cthat althouga private compact with an enemy may be prejudicial to a state in some degree, yet if it tends to avoid a greater evil, it shall bind the state, and ought to be considered as a public good.\u201d The Owners therefore of the cargo in question, though non-residents at the time of the capitulation and out of the reach of personal injury, yet having estates in the Island, in danger of confiscation by conquest, had a right to avail themselves of the terms proffeed by the capitulation, and engage a neutrality of conduct, by acceding to it.\nBut it is said \"that very possibly some of these non-residents are at this day in the military service of Great Britain.\u201d\nOur opinion is, that the 9th article, with regard to all absentees, and such as are in the service of Great Britain, only exempted their estates from forfeiture by the rights of conquest. The rights and privileges of trade are considered only by the 13th article. No one can bring himself within the 13th article, that has not signed the capitulation, and every one who signs the capitulation engages a neutrality of conduct. If any one subscribing the capitulation should afterwards go into the service of Great Britain and commit acts of hostility against France and America, he would break his engagement of neutrality, and forfeit all the rights and privileges of trade, and his property captured at sea would become prize.\nIt is a rational construction to consider neutrality as the great basis of the capitulation. The estates indeed of absentees, and such as were engaged in the service of Great Britain, appear to have been secured at all events from forfeiture, without a stipulation for neutrality; but with regard to the rights and privileges of trade, they can be only exercised by those who have acceded to the capitulation and engaged a neutrality. Admitting then that the owners of estates in the Island of Dominica, and non-residents and claimants in the cause, have properly acceded to the capitulation; the mere question is, whether they come within the 13th article, and are entitled to the rights and privileges of trade there conceded? As we conceive that this article was conceded as a liberal compensation for the stipulation of neutrality, we have no doubt but that these non-residents, who owned estates in Dominica and have acceded to the capitulation and neutrality, come within the description of the 13th article, and are entitled to all the rights and privileges of trade, which it provides for and stipulates.\nThe third ground of argument, on which it is contended, that this cargo is not protected by the capitulation against capture, is this: That the proceeds of the cargo were to be principally remitted to Great Britain, on the order of the owners resident there, and therefore that this cargo was in a line of trade not within the protection of the capitulation. We have already given it as our opinion, that the 13th article gives the capitulants a protected trade to every port, where the trade and commerce of France extends. And we have given, it as our opinion, that with regard to the rights and privileges of trade, there is no difference between the inhabitants, and those absentees, non-residents, who have acceded to the capitulation and neutrality. The only circumstance then to take this cargo out of the protection of the capitulation must be the letters of advice of the agents at Dominica, advising the consignees at Amsterdam, to whom the cargo belonged, and that the proceeds of the principal part of it were to be at the disposal and order of the owners, residents in Great Britain. We cannot see the force of this circumstance in the extent contended for, if the agents rightfully exported the produce of the estates of those, non-residents, in conformity to the capitulation. The letters of advice cannot give this commercial act a different complexion; the agents could not ship this property in their own right, without taking upon themselves a risk of the voyage; and the Bills of Lading necessarily allowed that the proceeds were at the disposal of the owners. Could agents have acted with more propriety? Every step they took was the natural result of the rights of trade conceded by the capitulation. But it is objected, \u201cthat the both article shews, that no remittance was to be made, but for education and support of children.\u201d\nThe article is this: \u201cThe inhabitants of the Island shall have, liberty to send their children to England, to be there educated, and to send them back again, and to make remittances to them while in England.\u201d\nThis article by no means proves, that no remittances were to be made of proceeds on sales in a neutral country; tho\u2019 the children might have had remittances in that train of intercourse, yet the mode might have been thought too circuitous and dilatory. A remittance in a direct line was more eligible. Besides, remittances on sales abroad could only be in money or, bills; but by this article there is no limitation of the species of remittance, and it may be in produce.\nThe capitulation must receive a liberal construction. It was the fabrick of a great, enlightened, General, and every part of the structure exhibits a liberality and grandeur of spirit, that does honor to human nature. It is said, that if the property of the capitulants is thus protected from capture, it is in a better situation than French, American or British property; it it precisely in the situation of neutral property. It was far from being the with of the capitulants to have had their property placed in such a predicament upon the terms it was done. They were reduced and obliged to submit to it by force of arms. But the situation of those people is mentioned as a happy one: If to be a conquered people, and inforced to all the contingent consequences of a conquest, be a pleasing condition, these people may then boast of their being in an happy one.\nIt is said the British crown must be benefited by this condition of their subjects.\nThe British crown may indeed be benefited in some degree; it was not meant to deprive Great Britain of every benefit; the draws some benefit from having a few remittances made from sales abroad, to a few of her subjects in England, owning estates in Dominica. But then to gain the advantage the yields up the personal service of those subjects, for they are bound to observe a neutrality. But has Great Britain lost nothing by the conquest? Who possesses the Island of Dominica? Who possesses all the advantages and benefits of its trade? Who has obtained its commercial revenues?\nIt is true the is not at the expence of the government of that island. But it is true the has lost, Island, government and revenues. When the consignees disposed of the cargo, they became debtors for the monies received. The making of remittances in satisfaction of debts, although to subjects of a nation at war, is no violation of the duties of a citizen. Nor will the usage and practice of civilized nations forbid it. Tobacco shipped to France, with an avowed intent to remit the proceeds to England for the payment of debts, would not be prize on an American capture.\nWe come now to the fourth ground of argument, on which it is contended, that this cargo is not within the protection of the articles of capitulation; that is, that the voyage was calculated for Great Britain, and not for Amsterdam in Holland, and therefore in breach and out of the protection of the capitulation. This argument is grounded upon several circumstances and upoevidence, that point at some latent object, but do not speak decisively upon it: They prove a secrecy and concealment, with regard to the voyage to Dominica, and the taking a cargo there; but all these circumstances are easily explained, without adopting the idea that the voyage was intended for Great Britain. What is suggested in Capt. Waterburgh's letter, was a mere precautionary measure to avoid British cruizers, that perpetually harrassed the Dutch trade, by capturing their vessels. In the same letter he mentions the capture of a Holland ship which had been carried into St. Kitts and released; the letter is dated Eustatia; and the man\u0153uvres he mentioned were to secure the voyage to Dominica.\nThe voyage from Dominica to Amsterdam, we have no doubt, was planned in London, between the capitulants there, owning estates in Dominica, and Daniel Hesbuysen, agent for Brantlight & Son. The letter addressed, to Moreson, at Dominica, was dated at Amsterdam, tho' wrote in London, because Brantlight & Son lived at Amsterdam, and because the cargo was to be consigned to them at Amsterdam, and it was dated the day of the date of his own letter, which inclosed it, because it was then wrote. As for the secrecy enjoined in Brantlight & Son's letter to Captain Waterburgh while at Eustatia, with regard to the voyage to Dominica and the taking a cargo there, we cannot think they had any other motive for it than such as often influences merchants in the conduct of a fair trade, to keep to themselves their commercial plans. But what force can there circumstances have when opposed by the positive evidence that is produced? The Bill of Lading and a variety of letters from the shippers and attornies for the owners in London, some addressed to Brantlight & Sonand others to the owners, prove that the voyage was for Amsterdam; all the ship papers also prove it. But the depositions of Waterburgh and Moreson, to whom the ship was consigned, and by whom the ship was loaded, are conclusive: They, upon clearing out of the ship, swear expressly that she was destined for Amsterdam.\nWe are now come to the last ground, which has been taken to prove the cargo not to be protected by the articles of capitulation, which is: That the property of the cargo on board, was the property of British subjects, not residents or owning estates in Dominica. But what is the evidence produced to prove this? It is a letter from Moreson to Brantlight & Son, in which be mentions the alarm occasioned by the rupture between Great Britain and the Stales General, and the fears and apprehensions the merchants and shippers were under, relative to putting property on board a Holland, vessel; he afterwards mentions the arrival of the king\u2019s proclamation, protecting Holland vessels from capture, and says \u201ceven then no one but Mr. \u201cKender Mason and myself would put a hogshead on board \u201cyour ship, as the king\u2019s proclamation laid so much blame on \u201cyour city; but we have agreed, &c.\u201d and then says they havagreed to ship, and assigns the reasons.\nThe fact does not appear, that Kender Mason had any property at all in Dominica, nor that he had any attorney or agent; it appears he lived in London, and was a correspondent of Moreson's House in Dominica. It appears Daniel Hesuysen, as agent for Brantlight & Son, obtained a letter from this Kender Mason addressed to Moreson, which he enclosed to Captain Waterburgh at St. Eustatia, and in consequences of which Captain Waterburgwas ordered to Dominica. This letter was probably delivered by Waterburgh, as it is not to be found among the ship\u2019s papers. We have no evidence of the contents of this leter, but it appears to us, to have been a letter recommending Brantlight & Son to Moreson's House. The plan of the voyagbeing settled in London, it was natural to obtain letters of introduction from thence.\nBut Moreson's letter, it is objected, speaks expressly of Kender Mason having shipped property, on board, and there is no proof, that he is a British capitulant, and therefore, here was property on board belonging to a British subject, who was neither a resident in Dominica, nor an owner of estate there, and, consequently, it was British property not protected by the capitulation.\nMoreson\u2019s letter, if good evidence, to prove the fact with regard to Kender Mason, must be taken as good evidence to prove every fact stated in it; for it must be taken altogether and admitted, or rejected in toto.\nHe says then, \u201cNo one but Kender Mason and myself, would \u201cput a hogshead on board, &c.\u201d Moreson then, as well as Kender Mason, had property on board. Moreson also mentions in his letter, that afterwards there was an agreement to ship generally, and assigns the reasons. The shippers must be other persons besides Mason and Moreson: So that even upon the evidence of Moreson\u2019s letter, Kender Mason could have but a part of the cargo, the quantum of which is not at all ascertained.\nBut we are inclined to think, that this letter of Moreson's, with regard to Kender Mason shipping property on board, is a mistake. Kender Mason was certainly not at Dominica, and yet the letter conveys that idea: \"A general panic had seized the merchants, they would not ship until the arrival of the King\u2019s Proclamation, and even then Kender Mason and myself were the only persons who would ship a hogshead.\u201d The person Moreson meant to speak of must have been on the spot. He was one whom the panic had not taken hold of; he was one who with Moreson took the resolution to ship, notwithstanding the alarming rupture between Great Britain and the States General; he was one who was led to ship from a confidence in the King\u2019s Proclamation. We have it in evidence that Captain Waterburgh had letters of recommendation both to Moreson and a Mr. Alexander Henderson. These letters were inclosed to the captain in a letter from Brantlight & Sons. It appears, that on the captain\u2019s application to Moreson, nothing could be done without Henderson; Moreson and Henderson were the persons who were consulted, and the first who moved to provide a loading for the ship. It appears from the Bills of Lading, that Henderson Was a principal shipper. There circumstances considered, the supposition which was made by the counsel for the claimants, is not altogether without foundation, that Kender Mason, was by mistake inserted for Henderson.\nBut be the fact as it may, we must determine according to the weight of evidence. The Bills of Lading shew, that Kender Mason had no property on board; for every, bill mentions the person to whom the property belongs, and each bill has a deposition annexed to it, proving the property mentioned to be the property of the persons mentioned, and it appears that these was no other property than what was mentioned in the Bills of Lading, and no where in those Bills is the name of Kender Mason to be found. To say then that Kender Mason had property on board, is to say that upwards of twenty persons have committed perjury, for there is that number of Bills of Lading and depositions: A mere assertion in a letter can never be suffered to weigh down such a powerful combination of positive proof on oath.\nHaving now considered all the grounds, on which it was objected that the cargo was, in this case, not protected by the articles of capitulation\u2014we are of opinion that this cargo was protected by the articles against all French and Britijh captures ; and, if America is bound by the articles,, protected also from American captures. But the question is, whether the articles of capitulation bind America? Vattel, a celebrated writer on the laws of nations, says, \"when two nations make war a common cause, they act as one body, and the war is called a society of war; they are so clearly and intimately connected, that the Fus Postliminii takes place among them, as among fellow subjects.\u201d It appears from the established form of Ransom Bills, that a compact of that nature binds the ally, and it appears by the Passport granted by the French Governor, of Dominica, that he considers the capitulation as obligatory upon America; for he requires all commanders of French vessels, and all commanders of Spanish vessels, and American vessels, the allies of France, not to impede the navigation of said ship, in her passage to Amsterdam; for that the shippers of the cargo were capitulants, under the protection of the French crown. From the very nature of the connection between allies, their compacts and agreements with the common enemy must bind each other, when they tend to accomplish the objects of the allies. Both nations have one common interest and one common object. If such agreements, when correspondent to the terms upon which the alliance is formed and calculated for the attainment of the views and designs which gave birth to it, do not bind the ally, then the consequence would be, that the ally would reap all the fruit and advantages of the compact without being subject to the terms and conditions of it; while the enemy with whom the compact is made, is exposed, with regard to the ally, to all the disadvantages of it, without participating of all the benefits stipulated; an inequality of obligation reprobated by every principle of reason and justice.\nIf America is not bound by the capitulation, then it can give no security to the capitulants, nor can they with safety exercise the rights and privileges of trade conceded to them. America being in alliance with France, the ports of France are opened to our armed vessels; and an American privateer might post herself in the ports of Dominica, watch the sailing of the ships from that port, pursue and capture them. Under such circumstances thtrade and commerce of the Island would be totally annihilated. But not only the capitulants would suffer; France would equally suffer; for, if exportation ceases; the commercial revenue of the Island must cease with it.\nThe conquest of Dominica was productive of great advantages to the common cause. It was a considerable reduction of the power and resources of Great Britain; it placed a great body of her subjects in a state of neutrality; it lessened the commerce and revenues of her government, and eventually deprives her of a part of her dominions.\nBut if America is not bound by the capitulation, neither can the capitulants be bound with regard to America; for no engagement can be a valid one, which ties up the hands of one party, and leaves the other party at full liberty to exercise, on the party bound, all the rights of war.\nThen, what should we think of the French Governor of Dominica, were he to suffer the capitulants to fit out armed vessels, to cruize against America. But it is said, that the capitulation, so far as it is contended to bind America, is unequal; for American property exported from Dominica would be liable to British capture, which British property would not.\nThis argument is not a fair one; it blends together what ought to be distinguished; a difference ought to be observed between the property of British subjects and British capitulants. British subjects, not capitulants, may rightfully capture American property: Americans may rightfully capture their property; but British capitulants cannot capture American property; and therefore it is a perfect equality, that Americans shall not capture the property of capitulants.\nBut it is thought strange, that while French, Spanish, American and British property should be liable to capture, the property of the capitulants should be exempted from it.\nLet us advert for a moment to the peculiar situation of those capitulants. They are a conquered people and reduced to the government of France; they are by compact a neutral body; they have neither the power of war, nor peace ; they commit hostilities against no nation; neither against France, nor Spain, nor America, nor Britain; where then is the strangeness in the doctrine, that the property of a people thus reduced, thus defenceless, and thus acting in the line of neutrality, should be protected from capture?\nBut the resolutions of Congress, with regard to Bermudas and other Islands, have been objected, and it is said that Count d\u2019 Estaing captured the vessels belonging to those Islands, though, by the resolve of Congress, they we re exempted from capture; which, it is contended, shews that the agreement of one ally does not bind the other. The resolutions of Congress cannot be considered as a compact with the people of Bermudas and the other Islands; for those people were not in a capacity to make a compact; they were under subjection to the British Crown, and had no authority from the Crown to enter into engagements with America. The resolutions therefore of Congress were a mere voluntary suspension of the rights of war, with regard to those people, the continuance of which was perfectly optional with America.\nIf France was bound by these resolutions of Congress, the would only be bound in the extent that America was. America might say when the pleased, that those resolutions should not exist, and so might France.\nBut if France was bound to a neutrality with regard to Bermudas and thofe other Iflands ; then Bermudas and thofe other Iflands were bound to a neutrality with regard to France : But thofe Iflands were not bound, therefore France was not bound ; and Count d\u2019EJlaing was well juftified in the captures he made.\nWith regard then to the question,\u201c whether the articles of \"capitulation bind America,\u201d we are of opinion that they do.\nBut the claimants take a ground which they say will save the cargo at all events and this ground is the ordinance of Congress, which relates to the rights of neutrality.\nCongress, October 1786, taking into consideration the declaration of her Imperial Majesty of Russia, with regard to the rights of neutrality, adopt the principles of the declaration, and appoint a committee to report resolutions conformable to them. Resolutions are reported, and on the 7th of April 1781, before the capture in the present case, Congress pass an ordinance ascertaining a set of instructions for commanders of armed vessels, the 3d. and 4th of which areas follow:\n3d. \"You shall permit all neutral vessels freely to navigation \"the high seas or coast of America, except such as are employ-\u201ced in carrying contraband goods, or soldiers, to the enemies \"of these United States.\u201d\n4th. \u201cYou shall not seize or capture effects belonging to \"the subjects of the belligerent powers on board of neutral of \"vessels, excepting contraband goods. &c.\u201d\nGreat Britain, before the capture, had commenced hostilities against the States General; but by proclamation exempted from capture, for a limited time, all ships and vessels, belonging to the States General of the United Provinces, carrying the produce or manufactures of Dominica, according to the articles of capitulation. The ship in this case was the property of Brantlight and Son, subjects of the States General, carrying the produce of Dominica according to the capitulation. She was captured by a British privateer, within the limited time; and on a supposition that America is not bound by the articles of capitulation; her cargo was the property of British subjects at war with America. This case comes expressly within the fourth instruction; the ship is certainly within the predicament of neutral property, and the cargo is the property of subject of a belligerent power.\nBut, it is said, that the rights of neutrality were broken by the British capture.\nThe British capture was illegal; it was without authority from the British Crown. It was directly against the articles of capitulation, and in opposition to the British proclamation; it was a piratical act, in legal strictness, and only excusable on the circumstances of the case. But shall America violate rights of neutrality, because another nation has done it? Or, which is the present case, because a subject, without authority from his nation, has done it? Did the ship cease to be a neutral ship by the capture, and did the cargo cease to be British property? If not; then, at the time of the recapture, the ship was a neutral ship, and the cargo, effects belonging to the subjects of a belligerent power, and so expressly within the 4th instruction. But it is objected, \u201cthat Great Britain has not acceded to the rights of neutrality, and therefore the property on board a neutral vessel ought not to be protected.\"\nThe ordinance of Congress makes no exception of Great Britain; for it says, you shall not seize or capture effects belonging to the belligerent powers on board of neutral vessels. Great Britain is here beyond a doubt comprehended; for the was a belligerent power when the ordinance passed.\nBut it is said this ordinance of Congress is obligatory only on commanders of Vessels, but not in the Courts of Admiralty anAppeal. We cannot think that this objection was seriously made.\nUpon the whole, we are of opinion that the decree below with regard to the ship, be confirmed; and with regard to the cargo, that it be reversed, and the cargo be charged with the stipulated freight.", "author": "By the Court", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": ["After argument by Wilcox, Lewis and Sergeant, for the Appellants, and Morris and Wilson for the Appellees,"], "head_matter": "Miller et. al.

But this is not to be drawn into precedent; nor is any point previously determined, to be brought again into litigation, unless the state of the facts respecting it shall be altered by the new evidence.\nThe causes were, accordingly, argued for several successive days; and on the 24th of January 1782, the following revisionary decree (altering the suspended decree only as to a part of the cargo) was delivered by WILLIAM PACA, and CYRUS GRIFFIN, the presiding Commissioners.\nBy the Court. We have considered the new evidence which has been laid before us, and we have also considered the observations and arguments, which the Counsel upon both sides have made upon it.\nOn the first argument we were of opinion, that the ship ought to be considered in the predicament of neutral property, and entitled to all the rights and privileges of neutrality, which the Ordinance of Congress ascertained and conferred; we took up this idea from a construction of the articles of capitulation and the British proclamation, which issued immediately on the rupture between Great Britain and the States General, and which protected the ship Resolution for a limited time from British Capture on her passage from Dominica to Amsterdam: We conceived, that the neutrality of the States General, with regard to the ship, abstractedly considered, was not broken by the rupture; the proclamation having controuled the extent of the war, by its exemption of the ship from being a subject of hostility and capture.\nSuch was our opinion on the first argument: But on consideration of the last argument, we are of a different opinion.\nThe writers upon the law of nations, speaking of the different kinds of war, distinguish them into perfect and imperfect: A perfect war is that which destroys the national peace and tranquility, and lays the foundation of every possible act of hostility: The imperfect war is that which does not entirely destroy the public tranquility, but interrupts it only in some particulars, as in the case of reprisals.\nBefore Great Britain commenced war with the States General, the States were a neutral nation with regard to the war between Great Britain, France, Spain, and America: They had taken no part in the war, and were a common friend to all. This is precisely the legal dea-of a neutral nation: It implies two nations at war, and a third in friendship with both. The war which Great Britain commenced with the States General was a perfect war. It destroyed the national peace of the States General, and with it the neutrality of the nation. The States became a party in the general war against Britain: They were no longer a common friend to the belligerent powers; and therefore they ceased to be a neutral nation.\nWar having thus destroyed the neutrality of the States General, they can never resume the character of a neutral until they are in circumstances to resume the character of a common friend to Great Britain, France, Spain and America: But this character is not to be acquired, while war subsists between them and Great Britain. Only a peace, therefore, between Britain and the States, can put the States in a capacity to resume their original character of neutrality. But there can be no peace without the concurrence of both nations: The British could not therefore, by the mere authority of their proclamation, restore back to the Ship Resolution her original neutrality. The Proclamation could only operate as a protection of the Ship from British capture.\nWe, therefore, layout of question the ordinance of Congress with regard to the rights of neutrality; this case is not within it. But the Ship Resolution is captured and both Ship and Cargo are libelled as prize. A question is made; on whom lies the onus probandi? We think on tire captors. There can be no condemnation without proof that the Ship or Cargo is prize; and it cannot be expected, that the persons who contest the capture will produce that proof.\nEvery capture is at the peril of the party. A privateer is not authorized to capture every vessel found on the high sea: She is commissioned to capture only such ships as are the property of the enemy. Every ship indeed may, in time of war, be brought to and examined; but the is not to be seized and captured, without the captors have just grounds to think the is the property of an enemy, and not the property of subjects of a nation in peace and friendship, or neutrality. If such seizure and capture are made without just grounds, the party injured is entitled to have an action for damages: And it is the policy of all nations at war to oblige the captains of privateers to give bond and security, to enforce a proper conduct while at sea, and to prevent seizures and captures from being wantonly made.\nThe sea is open to all nations: No nation has an exclusive property in the sea. Put the case then, that a privateer meets a ship at sea; is it to be inferred, from the mere circumstance of the ship\u2019s being found on the high seas, that she is the property of an enemy? Surely there is no ground for such an inference: On this ground a privateer might seize and capture the ships of its own nation. But the privateer attacks, seizes, captures and brings the ship into port: It is plain here is an act of violence; a seizure and capture. The captain therefore must do two things: At all events he must shew just grounds for the violence or he will be punishable at law by an action of damages: and in the next place, before he can obtain condemnation, he must prove the ship to be the property of an enemy; for, it can never be enough for condemnation, that he found the ship at sea.\nThe captors say: \u201cThat in the present case, they had not only \"just grounds for seizure; but they have also just grounds for \u201ccondemnation: For both the ship and cargo were found i\u201c the possession of British subjects, and therefore British pro-\u201cperty.\u201d\nIt must be admitted that possession is a presumptive evidencof property because possession is a circumstance which generally accompanies property, and, therefore, the seizure and capture, in the present case, was a violence at all events justified the law of nations, and for which no action would lie, even on acquittal of the Ship and Cargo. But the possession in this case is no ground for condemnation: For what is the nature of presumptive evidence? It only has the force of evidence which it remains uncontested. The possession is clearly accounted for: The ship came into the hands of the enemy by capture; and the prior possession was in the hands of Dutch subjects, and not British subjects. The presumption therefore relied on by the captors is defeated, and the argument founded on the possession is in favor of the claimants.\nOn the question of Prize or no Prize, what evidence does the law of nations admit for the determination of it?\nThe national interest of every commercial country requires, that some mode or criterion be adopted to ascertain the ship, cargo, destination, property and nation to which such ship belongs; not only as a security for a fair commerce according to law; but as a guard against fraud and imposition in the payment and collection of duties, imposts and commercial revenues. The peace also and tranquility of nations equally require, that the like criterion should be adopted, to distinguish the ships of different countries found be the high seas in time of war; to prevent an indiscriminate exercise of acts of hostility, which may lay the foundation of general and universal war. Hence it is, that every commercial country has directed, by its laws, that its ships shall be furnished with a set of papers called Ship Papers: And this criterion the law of nations adopts, in time of war, to distinguish the property of different powers, when found at sea; not indeed as conclusive, but presumptive evidence only. Bills of lading, letters of correspondence, and all other papers on board, which relate to the ship or cargo, are also considered as prima facie evidence of the facts they speak; because such papers naturally accompany such a mercantile transaction.\nSuch then is the evidence which the law of nations admits on a question of prize or no prize; and it is on this evidence that vessels with their cargoes are generally acquitted or condemned: And therefore, if in this case the papers on board affirm the ship and cargo to be such property as is not prize, there must be an acquittal, unless the captors are able, by a contrariety of evidence, to defeat the presumption which arises from the papers, and can shew just grounds for condemnation. On the other hand, if the papers affirm the ship and cargo to be the property of an enemy, there must be a condemnation, unless they who contest the capture can produce clear and unquestionable evidence to prove the contrary.\nThe papers on board, the manifest, clearance, bills of lading, the depositions annexed, the certificates of the Chief Justice of Dominica, the French Governor's passport, and the letters of correspondence from the shippers, collectively taken, prove the Ship to be the property of Brantlight & Son, subjects of the States General, at the port of Amsterdam, and the cargo to be the property of British capitulants, residing or owning estates in the Island of Dominica, and entitled to the rights of commerce according to the capitulation on the conquest of that Island; except with regard to such parts of the cargo as were shipt by Morson, & Co. Morson, Vance, & Co. and Lovel, Morson, & Co.\nIt lies then on the captors to obviate the force of this evidence: It must be obviated, or an acquittal must be decreed, to the full extent of the evidence.\nThe paper's have been taken up by the Counsel for the captors and separately and distinctly considered, and it is said they do not prove the facts to which they are adduced. It is true, separately considered, they do not; but collectively taken, we think they do, except in the instances we have mentioned.\nMany objections have been made to obviate the force of this presumptive evidence: The objections go to the competency of many of the papers, and to the credibility of all. \u201cThe certi-\u201cficates of the Chief Justice, it is said, ought not to be admit-\u201cted as legal and competent evidence; for the Chief Justice is \u201c a British Judge of the Island of Dominica, and an enemy.\u201d\nWe do not think the Chief Justice of that Island, reduced as it is by conquest, can with propriety be called a British Judge and an enemy. But whether he derives his commission originally from the Crown, and still holds it under the articles of capitulation, and so far is a British Judge, or not, he must certainly be subject to removal by the French government; and it highly derogates from the honor and dignity of the French Crown, and too deeply affects the zeal and loyalty of Governor Duchilot, to admit the supposition, that a man is suffered to fill so important an office, who publicly prostitutes his official character from a partiality to the British nation.\nThe Chief Justice gave his certificates officially and under the obligation of an oath: We must want charity indeed, if, under these circumstances, we were to say, that they have not even thforce of presumptive evidence.\nBut the competency of this evidence, so far as it is adduced to prove the owners or shippers of the cargo British capitulants, is objected to, on another ground. It is said; \u201cThese certificates \u201care not the best evidence the nature of the case will admit, \u201cand which the party has in his power to produce: An attest-\u201ced copy of the articles of capitulation, and the names subscri-\u201cbed, ought to have been produced.\u201d\nThis principle of evidence applies forcibly against the captors, but does not affect the claimants. The articles of capitulation bind Great Britain, France and America. It is a solemn compact or treaty. All the parties to it, the citizens of each nation, are morally bound by it: And it is not only admitted, but contended for, by the counsel for the captors, that even neutral nations are under a moral obligation to regard it; and that it is upon this principle the law of nations takes cognizance of and determines upon it.\nThe papers on board shew a fair commerce, and affirm the cargo to be the property of capitulants, except in the instances mentioned. If they are not capitulants, and yet British subjects, they have violated the capitulation, engaged in a fraudulent and illicit commerce, and are chargeable with a breach of moral obligation. The claimants stand upon two grounds of presumption: first, the presumption which arises from the papers; and then the presumption that no man would do that which he is morally bound not to do. The claimants cannot be affected while these presumptions remain uncontested. How are they to be contested? By what evidence? Certainly the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit, and which the captors have in their power to produce. And if an attested copy of the articles, and of the names subscribed is the best evidence to prove who are capitulants, it is the best to prove who are not capitulants; and, therefore, the captors ought, on their own principles, to produce it; they having it as much in their power to produce such copy as the claimants.\nBut it is said, \u201cthe ship\u2019s papers are defective; the register \u201cis not produced; it is withheld, and gives a ground of sus-\u201cpicion.\u201d\nWe hare no doubt, a register was on board at the time of the capture: But we do not think there is any ground for suspicion under the circumstances of the case.\nThe Resolution was captured by a British privateer. The British captain took possession pf the ship\u2019s papers, and captain Waterburgh, the captain of the Resolution, was made prisoner. Afterwards the Resolution was captured by the American privateer, and the American captain took possession of such papers, as the British captain had suffered to remain on board the Resolution. Captain Waterburgh was not brought into port with his ship.\nIt was the interest of both the British and American captains to withhold the register, if it proved the ship to be the property of subjects of the States General; and neither the British captain nor the American captain have made oath, that the papers produced to the Court are all the papers, which were found on board, and came respectively to their hands and possession.\nBut it is said, \"no credit or faith is to be given to those pa-\u201cpers, because replete, with contradiction and absurdity. The \u201c Manifest, it is said, contradicts the Bills of Lading & \u201cThe Manifest purports the property of the cargo to be in the \u201cpersons named therein as the shippers, and the Bills of La-\u201cding shew, in many instances, that the property is in others.\u201d\nThe Manifest exhibits a column under the description of shippers; and it also exhibits a column under the description of marks, and other columns for the cargo.\nThe Bills of Lading correspond with the column of marks; and the persons described as shippers in the Manifest, are ascertained by the Bills of Lading to be persons, who acted principally as attorneys, managers, or agents, for those who are mentioned in the Bills to own the property for which the Bills are taken; the property in the Bills being in the general produce of such owners\u2019 estates in Dominica. There is therefore no contradiction between the Manifest and Bills of Lading; for, the term shippers does not imply the property to be in such shippers; the term as properly applies to a factor, or attorney, or agent, as to the owner.\nBut, it is said, Governor Duchilot was imposed upon; that \u201che refers in his Passport and Certificate, which is endorsed on the \u201cManifest, to the 17th article of the capitulation; that the 17th article \u201cspeaks of such merchants as have goods or merchandize; and that therefore the Governor must have been informed that the shippers were the owners of the cargo.\u201d\nIt is time the 17th article says, the merchants may fell their merchandize, and carry on their trade, and the term their implies the property to be in them: But the term their may also apply to the property which a factor, agent or attorney has the possession management and shipment of, for others; for, although they have not the general, yet they have the special, property.\n\u201c But, it is said, the shippers dared not to avow the names othe persons mentioned in the Bills of Lading, from a consciousness that they were not capitulants, and that the Governor would have refused them a Licence, Passport and Certificate.\u201d\nIf the shippers felt such a consciousness, why avow the names of such in the Bills of Lading? It was not only necessary to take measures to prevent discovery on the Island, but also to guard against detention on a capture at sea. Why was the Governors Passport and Certificate obtained? Was it not to protect the ship and cargo from capture? But if the Manifest, Passporand Certificate had no reference to the Bills of Lading, but were contradictory and inconsistent, and the persons avowed by the Bills of Lading to be, the owners of the property were not capitulants, is it not a novelty in the game of fraud, to furnish a ship with such papers as proclaimed a contradiction to the Manifest, Passport and Certificate, announced the criminality of the commerce, and exposed both ship and cargo to capture and confiscation?\nPrudence required, and very probably it was enjoined by the Government, that before a ship should be suffered to clear out, and proceed on her voyage, proofs should be made and taken with her, not only that the shippers of the cargo were capitulants, but also, that the owners of the cargo were capitulants. It appears in this case, that above three fourths of this cargo, were shipped by agents, and attornies and factors. The Governor certifies the shippers to be capitulants. The chief Justice certifies the owners to be capitulants, and where his certificates are deficient, the depositions prove it. All this may be done, in conformity to the law, usage and practice of the Island.\nBut another contradiction is objected: It is said, \"the Bills of Lading contradict the other Papers, which import the property of the ship to be in Brantlight & Son; for the Bills consign the cargo to Brantlight & Son; and therefore it is contended, the property of the ship could not be in Brantlight & Son; because it is observed to direct a man to pay freight to himself. \"The Bills of Lading are not chargeable with any such absurdity. The freight is not directed to be paid to Brantlight & Son; the freight is to be paid to the captain; he is responsible for the wages of his crew, and other debts, contracted on account of the ship. Freight is answerable for all such claims, and the captain is entitled to receive it, to indemnify himself: He may, therefore, refuse to deliver the cargo, till the freight is paid. And by this means, in case of the bankruptcy of his owners, he is sure of an indemnification, to the extent of the freight.\nBut still another contradiction is objected: It is said, \"that both the Bills of Lading, and the oath of Morson, on the back of the Manifest, contradict the assertion of the other papers, that the ship is the property of Brantlight & Son: for, they prove the consignment of ship to Brantlight & Son; and therefore, it is contended, the property could not be in them, because it is absurd to consign a ship to the owners.\u201d We do not see any such absurdity. Consignment is a mercantile phrase, adopted to distinguish the person, to whole care a ship is addressed, and, when applied to the owners, it is merely in conformity to forms. It is the common usage and practice of merchants to apply, the phrase, indiscriminately, to owners, and others.\n\"But, it is said, the papers found on board, the Resolution, do not sufficiently prove the ship to be the property of Brantlight & Son, when the arrived at St. Eustatius, from Amsterdam, early in 1780.\u201d It is proved, by the oath of Morson, and captain Waterburgh, endorsed on the back of the Manifest, that this property was subsisting, if not at the time of the deposition, yet, at least, on the arrival of the ship at Dominica, October, 1780. And Morson, & Company\u2019s letter, to Brantlight & Son, dated 6th March, 1781, after the rupture with Holland, and shortly before the ship left Dominica, and which was found on board proves the property to be then subsisting: for, in the close of the letter, they say, \"captain Waterburgh has drawn on you, in our favour, for disbursement, \u00a3191:15s;\" which disbursement plainly refers to disbursements of the ship, which Brantlight & Son could not be chargeable with, if they had parted with the property, and were no longer owners.\nNo evidence at all is produced to shew a change property, or transfer of the ship. And, therefore, the fact being admitted, that she was the property of Brantlight & Son, on her arrival at St. Eustatia, in 1780, and the property being proved to be subsisting in March, 1781, and proved, to be subsisting in March, 1781, a few days before the sailed from Dominica, we cannot doubt, but that the property was subsisting, at the time of her capture. She was then no prize to the British privateer; because protected by the British Proclamation: She was no prize to the American privateer because she was the property of the subjects of the States General, a nation in peace and friendship with America.\n\"But the papers, it is said, prove the cargo to be the property of persons, not capitulants: For Morson & Company, in their letter of the 6th March, 1781, speak of Kender Mason, as a shipper, who is not a capitulant.\u201d\nWhat does this letter say? It is addressed to Brantlight & Son, and informs them, that the rupture with Holland, occasioned all shipments to stop; that afterwards, the British Proclamation, protecting the Holland vessels from capture, for a limited time, on their passage back from Dominica, came to hand; that even then, no one but Kender Mason and themselves would ship; that, afterwards, shipment went generally on.\nThis letter proves clearly, that the cargo was shipped by many different persons. Not only Kender Mason shipped, but Morson & Company also shipped, and there were other shippers, who were alarmed, notwithstanding the British Proclamation, and would not immediately ship, though afterwards they proceeded to ship.\nTo what extent did Kender Mason ship? Morson & Co\u2019s letter, which is the only evidence that he shipt at all, goes no further than to prove, that he shipt a part of the cargo. How shall this part be ascertained?\nThe ship, it is admitted, by counsel on both sides, was consigned to Morson & Co. and Alexander Henderson; and it appears from the papers on board, that upwards of two thirds of the cargo were shipt by Henderson, as agent and attorney for the British capitulants; the residue of the cargo was shipt, partly by James Morson, agent and attorney for British capitulants, partly by Morson & Co. and partly by others, in their own right, as agents and attornies for others.\nThe letter of correspondence, which Henderson addressed to Brantlight & Son, to whom the ship and cargo were consigned, and his letters of correspondence, addressed to the gentleman at London, for whom he was agent and attorney; the bill of lading he took for the property shipt, and his deposition annexed to the said bill, give a fair history of such part of the cargo, as was shipt by him: They prove it to be the property of British capitulants, and not the property of Render Mason.\nThe depositions of James Morson, the bills of lading, and thcertificates of the Chief Justice, point out and ascertain, what part of the cargo he shipt as agent and attorney, and prove it to be the property of British capitulants, and not the property of Kender Mason.\nThe depositions, bills of lading; manifest, letters of correspondence, the Governor\u2019s passport and certificate, and the deposition of Morson and Fitzgerald prove that the residue of the cargo, except what was shipt by Morson, & Co. Morson, Vance, & Co. and Lovel, Morson & Co. was the property of British capitulants, and not the property of Kender Mason.\nIf Mason, then, had any property on board, that property must have been in such parts of the cargo as were shipt by Morson, & Co. Vance, & Co. and Lovel, Morson, & Co. With regard to this part of the cargo, the evidence is not full and compleat: For, altho\u2019 Morson is proved to be a capitulant, yet the company is neither ascertained, nor proved to consist of capitulants.\nBut it is contended, that the property shipt by Henderson was the property of Kender Mason.\nOn what ground is the idea taken up, that Mason had any property at all on board? It is founded solely on that part of Morson & Co.'s, letter, which mentions Kender Mason as a Shipper. Exclusively of this letter, there is nothing, besides mere conjecture and possibility, to prove that he had any property at all on board.\nThis much much be clear; that if Henderson was meant, then Mason was not meant.\nMorson & Co. say in their letter, \"that even after the arrival \"of the British proclamation, no one but Kender Mason, and \"ourselves, would immediately ship.\u201d If Henderson was not meant for Kender Mason, then Henderson was amongst those who ware still alarmed, and would not immediately ship, on the arrival of the British proclamation; and, consequently, Kender Mason could have no property in what was shipt by Henderson: for it is absurd to say, that Kender Mason proceeded to ship, and Henderson did not, if what Henderson shipt was the property of Kender Mason.\nBut, it is objected, \"that altho\u2019 Kender Mason is mentioned in the letter, as a shipper, yet it is to be understood, that he is there described as principal to Henderson, and therefore, what was shipt by Henderson, may with propriety be said to have been, shipped by Kender Mason.\u201d\nWhat evidence, is there of such a connection between Mason and Henderson? Mason's letters of correspondence are all addressed to Morson, and the ship is consigned to Morson and Henderson, as persons in separate and distinct interests. The idea too, of such a connection, is contradicted by the whole tenor of the papers found on board.\nIf Henderson was the agent, or attorney for Kender Mason; if he was the person, with whom Mason was so extensively interested, in his commercial connections, then the idea of his connection with Morson & Co. Morson, Vance, & Co. and Lovel, Morson, & Co. ought to be abandoned: for, it is not to be believed, that Mason should engage in three partnerships, and yet employ an agent or attorney, who ships forty times, the quantity of produce shipt by all the three partnerships.\nBut it is contended, \u201cthat both ship and cargo are the property of Morson and Mason, in consequence of a plan concerted at London, between Kender Mason and Hesbuysen, agent for Brantlight & Son, while the Ship Resolution lay at Eustatius.\"\nWe have no doubt the voyage of the Resolution was planned at London, by Kender Mason and Hesbuysen; but the plan must at have been very different from the one suggested.\nOne of two propositions must be true; either Morson and Mason did not purchase the ship, and ship the cargo, in consequence of the plan suggested, or Morson has sworn falsely, and committed a perjury.\nMorson, the 7th March, 1781, near twelve months after the Resolution\u2019s voyage was concerted at London, swears that the Ship Resolution, belonging to the port of Rousseau, and owned by Brantlight & Son, arrived at Dominica, Oct. 1780; for the purpose of taking on board a cargo of sugar and coffee, the property of capitulants.\nThis oath flatly contradicts the assertion, that the Ship was purchased; it also directly contradicts the assertion, that the plan was to ship a cargo, the property of Kender Mason; for Kender Mason is not a capitulant.\nMorson's knowledge was competent to the facts he swore: He precisely knew what the plan was that was really concerted at London; for, it is strenuously contended by the counsel for the captors, that Kender Mason, in his letter to Morson & Hesbuysen, enclosed to Waterburgh, contained a full communication of it.\n\" But the papers, it is said, found on board the Eustin, throw \"great light upon the subject; they pluck off the mask, and \"exhibit Mason in his proper colours; they prove, that an illicit \"commerce has taken place, and that the articles of capitulation \"have been repeatedly violated.\u201d\nAdmit, for argument sake, the fact, that the Eustin was engaged in an illicit commerce, how can the conduct of the Eustin affect the Resolution ?\nBut what is this illicit commerce, which is charged to have taken place ? Let it be ascertained, and we shall find, it cannot possibly apply to the Resolution.\n\" British goods, it is said, have been shipt from London, to \" Dominica, thro\u2019 the intervention of neutral ports.\u201d Can this species of illicit commerce apply to the Resolution ? It is impossible; for she was never engaged in this Dominica trade, till after her arrival at Eustatia, early in 1780 ; and from thence she sailed to Dominica, where she lay, till the rupture between Great Britain and Holland took place; nor were Brantlight and Son ever engaged in such a commerce for Morson and Co\u2019s. letter, of the 6th March 1781, after the rupture, speaks of this house, as a new house, with which the people of Dominica were unacquainted; and mentions the difficulties he had, from that circumstance, to procure consignments.\n\"But the papers, it is said, of the Eustin prove that the \"produce of Dominica has been exported to London, through \"the intervention of neutral ports.\u201d\nWas the Resolution ever engaged in this species of illicit commerce? The peculiar circumstances of her case shew, that she never was. The rupture with Holland took place while she lay at Dominica; it stopped all shipments. On the arrival of the British proclamation, protecting Holland vessels, for a limited time, on their passage back, shipments went on; but the protection, which the proclamation gave, ceased on the arrival of Holland vessels back to their ports in Holland.\nWhat ground then is there to think, that the Resolution, with her cargo, were destined, after her arrival at Amsterdam, to proceed to London, where both ship and cargo, would have been liable, after her departure from Amsterdam, not only to British capture; but, as contended by the counsel for the captors, liable also to Dutch capture, war prohibiting all commerce between the belligerent powers; and not only liable to British and Dutch capture; but, as the law of nations has been stated by the counsel of the captors, liable also to French, Spanish and American capture?\n\u201c But the papers, it is said, of the Eustin, prove that Mor-\"son and Mason, who planned the voyage of the Resolution, \"also planned the voyage of the Eustin; and therefore, if the \"Eustin was engaged in an illicit commerce, the presumption is, that the Resolution was also employed in such commerce.\u2019\u2019\nWe have already observed, that the Resolution could not possibly be engaged in the illicit commerce, with which the Eustin is charged; but if Morson and Mason planned both voyages, Morson knew the plan on which the Resolution was chartered, and he has proved it, on oath, to be a fair one, and in perfect conformity to the articles of capitulation.\n\u201c But Mason, in his letter from Ostend, August 1781, found \"on board the Eustin, writes to Moreson, that he has nearly \"accomplished the plan, which he informed him of in his letter \"dated October 1780, from Rotterdam, and it is contended, \"that this letter proves, that a plan is established at Ostend, to \"centre there the whole Dominica trade, and to furnish British \"goods for Dominica, through that channel.\u201d Admit the facts to be so; how does it affect the Resolution and her cargo? The rupture with Holland had taken place, and the Resolution was captured, and brought into port, several months before the plan was accomplished at Ostend and, consequently, whatever illicit practice that plan points at, cannot apply to the Resolution. But it is said, that the plan established at Ostend, was the plan, which was concerted at London, and established at Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, and shifted from those cities to Ostend, on account of the rupture with Holland. If the plan, now established at Ostend, is nothing more than the plan adopted at London, with regard to the Resolution, then it is a fair one; for Morson has told us, what the plan was, and he has declared it on oath. But we are of opinion, that the system, now established at Ostend, is nothing more than the plan adopted at London, with regard to the Resolution: Then it is a fair one; for Morson has told us, what the plan was, and he has declared it on oath. But we are of opinion, that the system now established at Ostend is a new one, and that it is not a former plan, shifted from Holland to Ostend, on account of the rupture. It originated indeed before the rupture, and might have taken place in Holland, had it been completed before that event. It is of such a nature as requires Morson to take his residence at Ostend. It occasioned a change, in his commercial connection at London, and a dissolution of the partnership, in which he was there engaged. The cargoes shipped from Dominica, tho\u2019 consigned to Liber, Baas, Derd & Co. were nevertheless to be disposed of, under his superintendancy. It was upon this plan, whatever it was, that the Eustin failed; she may be affected by it, but the Resolution never can. We have said, the whole cargo of the Resolution is disproved to be the property of Mason, except such parts of it as were shipt by Morson & Co. and therefore if Mason had any property any property at all on board, it must be in such part of the cargo.\nWe feel the force of the reasoning which has been employed to shew, that the name of Kender Mason was inserted by mistake; but, as Mason, who appears to us to be a partner in three partnerships, and to have been the active person in shipping this part of the cargo, has acknowledged, for himself and company, that Kender Mason was a shipper, and the evidence, upon a careful review of it, leaves an opening to apply that acknowledgment to a concern in the three partnerships, we are led to change the opinion we had entertained on the first argument, with regard to this point, and now think, that this part of the cargo must be condemned as prize; and, not only Mason\u2019s proportion of it, but also the whole interest of the three partnerships: For, the shipping of produce by Mason, who is not a capitulant, is a violation of the capitulation; and as the three partnerships were consenting to it, and neglected their interest with Mason, they are participes criminis, and must equally suffer. So far we have thought proper to animadvert on the new evidence, and the argument and observations of the counsel upon it. And, altho\u2019 on a decree of acquittal, almost the whole cargo will go into the hands of those who are not the friends of America, notwithstanding they have stipulated a neutrality during the war; yet, as they are entitled to it, by the articles of capitulation which bind America, the law of nations operating on those articles as a solemn compact, commands that such a decree must be given. We hope we feel just impressions of the wrongs and cruelties of Great Britain; but public faith must be maintained; the honor and dignity of the United States preserved, and the law of nations dispassionately and righteously administered.\nWe therefore adjudge and decree, that the order of this court, suspending the original decree, be discharged, and the said original decree, be affirmed in all its parts, except with regard to such parts of the cargo, as were shipt by Morson & Co. Morson, Vance, & Co. and Lovell, Morson & Co. which parts of the cargo we do adjudge and decree to be condemned, for the use of the captors, chargeable, nevertheless, with the stipulated freight.", "author": "BY THE COURT:", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Miller, Libellant and Appellant, versus The Ship Resolution, &c. The Same, versus The Cargo of the Ship Resolution, &c.\nDecember Session, 1781.\nOn motion of Wilson, for the Appellants, a rule had been granted in September Session last, to shew cause, why there should not be a rehearing in there Appeals: 1st, because the decree had erred in fact; and 2d. because there had been a discovery of material testimony since it was pronounced: And, it was argued on the 26th December, 1781, by Morris, in support of the rule, and by Serjeant and Wilcocks, in opposition to it.\nIn support of the rule, It was said, that the re-hearing ought to be allowed, on the principle that humanum est errare; and by analogy to the practice of the Court of Chancery, founded on that principle. It is true, that the interest of the community requires, that there should be an end to controversies; but this must be attended to, consistently with doing justice. A re-hearing of the Chancellor\u2019s decree seems, indeed, to be a matter of course, on application, for that purpose, by any two Counsel of respectable character. Bo. Cur. Can. 240. 243. 364. 385. 405.\u2014The petition for a re-hearing was filed, as soon as information of the decree was received: There has, therefore, been no laches in making the application; and even when the Chancellor has made his final decree, the form of petition merely states that he has erred in conscience, as to the facts; and the application is seldom refused. But though the request of Counsel should not, of itself, be deemed sufficient, the discovery of new evidence subsequent to the decree, ought to be admitted,as a foundation for a re-hearing. By this evidence it will appear, that other vessels, though really British, have been fitted out by the same parties, under the same cover; and, of consequence, the inference will be strong that the Resolution was also British property.\nIn opposition to the rule, it was observed, that the most pernicious consequences would ensue, if a new trial should be granted upon every request, and that the payment of costs will not be a sufficient check; as the advantage of having the property in hand more than compensates that inconvenience. But in answering the causes assigned for a re-hearing, it was contended, that the Law of Chancery did not apply. In Chancery, the suits being new, and the parties liable to surprize, rehearings are frequently allowed; but in the House of Lords a re-hearing is never allowed. Nor is it consonant with the practice of this Court; though if the Court was itself dissatisfied with the principles of the decree, that would undoubtedly be a satisfactory reason for the measure. Besides, on a re-hearing in Chancery, no new evidence can be introduced; and the petition for a rehearing must state the reasons at large. 2. Prac. Ch. 450. Ibid. 10. But this application is in the nature of a Bill of review, and must, consequently, state new evidence. Ibid. 40. 452. 3 Black. Com. 451. 3 Atk. 35. 3 P. Win. 371. 372. Nor is the new evidence, which is assigned as another cause for a rehearing, admissible: It respects another vessel; and the papers found on board the ship herself must be the ground of acuittal, or condemnation."}}}, {"id": 6591154, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/6591154/", "name": "KEANE et al. v.

The first objection is, that a libel does not lie by the crew of a privateer, for their respective proportions of a prize. The second objection is, that the libellants, in this case, are not part of the privateer\u2019s crew, nor captors, entitled to a proportion of the prize stated in their libel.\nWith regard to the first objection, we are of opinion, that a libel does lie, and that it is the proper and regular mode of redress: for, the commission of a privateer, according to the form established by congress, extends not only to the captain, but also to the ship and crew; they are captors, as well as the captain, and their rights to the thing captured, is equally founded on the commission. The ship is figuratively considered as an agent, and represents the owners. Articles of agreement generally direct the distribution; but if no articles are executed, the admiralty courts will make distribution, in proportion to the number, interest and merits of the captors. But, it is said, \u201cthe admiralty court, in this case, had exercised all its jurisdiction and power; that a libel was filed by the captain, and a decree passed for condemnation; that the prize has been sold, and the money lodged in the hands of the marshal; that the marshal must make distribution according to the list of the crew, which the captain shall deliver; and if the captain makes a false list, the party injured has no other remedy than by an action at law.\u201d The original libel, we find, was filed by the captain, in behalf of himself and crew, and the decree adjudges the prize to the captors. The marshal has sold the prize, and the money lies in his hands; on application, he refuses to pay the libellants; and the question is, what is the mode of redress?\nWe are of opinion that the libellants had a double remedy: They had an action at law, for money had and received to their use; and they were entitled to a supplemental libel, upon which a decree and order might have been obtained, to compel the marshal to pay the money. Such a libel is nothing more than a form of proceeding, to carry into execution the original decree; and if the admiralty couits are competent to give judgment, they must be competent to carry it into execution. We are also of opinion, that if a marshal makes distribution, without the orders of the admiralty court, he does it at his peril. The list or return of the crew by the captain, is no justification for his payments. He is the officer to carry the decree of the court into execution, and he must take care that his payments are made according to such decrees; for, on misapplication of the payment, a libel will lie to make him responsible. If he would therefore act safely, he ought, before he makes his .payments, to obtain the order and direction of the court; and the admiralty courts ought not to make an order, without previous measures to guard against fraud and imposition, by providing for latent claims.\nBut on the second ground, it is said, the decree below ought to be reversed; which is, that the libellants are not part of the privateer\u2019s crew, nor captors, entitled to the prize stated in their libel. It is proved, and admitted on all hands, that the libellants were shipped on board the privateer, at Philadelphia; that they were shipped under the articles of agreement, and shipped and received on board, as part of the privateer\u2019s crew; that, as part of the privateer\u2019s crew, they navigated the privateer down to Chester; that there the captain, without any objection to their skill or ability, ordered them on shore, and obliged them to abandon the privateer, and left them; and that after-wards he, and all the residue of the crew, destroyed the original articles of agreement, and executed a fresh set.\nUnder the circumstances stated and admitted, we are of opinion, that the libellants are entitled to a full proportion of all prizes which were captured during the cruize, for which the libellants were engaged, and from which they were forcibly excluded. We have already observed, that the right of the crew to captures is not founded on the articles of agreement; but on the privateer\u2019s commission. When the libellants were shipped at Philadelphia, and received on board by the captain as part of the crew, the right under the commission attached. This right they derived from an authority, paramount to the captain, and therefore the captain could not arbitrarily deprive them of it. But it is said, the captain, only, did the wrong; and therefore he alone should be responsible for it, and not the residue of the crew.\nThe libellants do not seek a compensation for a wrong; they are not in pursuit of damages for a tort. When they were shipped and received on board at Philadelphia, they then became part of the crew, and the right to capture and make prizes was a right they held jointly with the ship and officers, and residue of the crew. The articles of agreement directed the distribution, and ascertained the share; and the libel is for shares, according to the articles. The demand, therefore, which the libellants make, does not lessen the shares of the residue of the crew, nor call on them for a compensation: it is a demand, which the residue of the crew acknowledged, and agreed to, when they executed the articles. But it is said, on the dismission of the libellants, their proportion of the risk and la-bour fell on the residue of the crew; and, therefore, they ought to have an additional compensation beyond the articles of agreement. Whatever compensation they may, in justice, be entitled to, they cannot dispense with, nor derive it from the articles of agreement The articles make no provision for such events, and no man, on board, can claim beyond the extent of the articles. On this ground it is, that although a mariner, who is once shipped on board, and is dismissed by the captain, without fault, before the voyage is ended, is entitled to his stipulated wages, for the whole voyage'; yet the residue of the crew can only claim to the extent of their contract; although, by the dismission of such mariner, the risk and labour become proportionally greater.\nBut, it is said, that after the dismission of the libellants, new articles were executed by the captain, and residue of the crew; by which their shares of prizes were augmented, in proportion to the lessening of the crew, by the libellants\u2019 dismission; and, that the libel-lants\u2019 claim affects their right, under the subsequent articles. The captain and the residue of the crew could not cancel the original articles-of agreement. When a contract is made, it can only be dissolved by the consent of all parties. The after articles, therefore, cannot affect the original articles, nor authorise a departure from them. These articles, instead of militating against the libellants\u2019 claim, tend to establish it on another ground: for, they shew that the residue of the crew approved of the dismission, and therefore ought to be considered as participes criminis, and equally responsible with the captain.\nBut, it is said, \u201cthat the libellants did not, by any personal service, contribute to the capture in the present case; that the prize was taken by the ship, the captain and officers, and residue of the crew; and, that although the libellants had a right under the commission to make captures, yet the right was not exercised in the capture of the prize in question.\u201d The ship, captain, officers, and crew, were joint-tenants of the right to capture and make prizes conceded by the commission. Whatever was acquired in consequence of this joint right and interest must be considered as common stock, and like the case of a joint partnership, not subject to sur-vivorship. Where the right and interest is a joint concern, the question never can be material, which of the parties have been most active and alert: the only question that can arise must be, whether the joint concern and interest is fairly subsisting.

The law of nations says, that a ship under those circumstances, is in the predicament of enemy\u2019s property, and subject to seizure and confiscation.\nBut it is said, \u201c the ordinance of Congress ascertains in what cases the rights of neutrality are forfeited; that the present case is not comprehended; and therefore, if not protected by the law of nations, yet it is protected by the ordinance of Congress. \u201d\nWe are of opinion, that Congress did not mean, by their ordinance, to ascertain in what cases the rights of neutrality should be forfeited, in exclusion of all other cases; for, the instances not mentioned are as flagrant as the cases particularized. The ordinance does not specify the case of a neutral vessel employed in carrying provision to a place which is besieged, and in want of bread : For, altho\u2019 one of the articles says, \u201c You shall per-\u201cmit all neutral vessels freely to navigate on the high seas, \u201cor the coasts of America, except such as are employed in car-\u201crying contraband goods, or soldiers, to the enemy;\u201d yet another article says, that the term contraband shall be confined to the articles there enumerated, and provision is omitted. Were Congress asked, whether they meant to protect from capture, a neutral ship loaded with provision, and destined for York and Gloucester, when besieged by the armies of the United States and France, no one could possibly doubt what their answer would be. The plain and obvious construction of the ordinance is, that while neutral vessels observe the rights of neutrality, they shall not be interrupted by American captures: Congress meant to pay a regard to the rights, and not to the violations of neutrality.\nBut, it is objected, \u201cthat in this case, if the Brig has violated the rights of neutrality, it is because she intended a violation of the capitulation of Dominica; that the capitulation of Dominica can only be considered as a local law, of which there can be no breach, until the offending ship comes within the civil jurisdiction of the island; that the Brig was captured before the arrival within the jurisdiction of Dominica; and that therefore she was captured, before there was any violation of the rights of neutrality.\u201d\nIf nothing could be objected against the Brig, but an intentional violation of the capitulation, abstractedly from the consequences, with regard to the war between Great Britain, France, and the United States, possibly such reasoning might be conclusive: But we are of opinion, that the Brig has done more than a mere intentional offence, with regard to the capitulation.\nThe subjects of a neutral nation, cannot, consistently with neutrality, combine with British subjects, to wrest out of the hands of the United States and of France, the advantages they have acquired over Great Britain by the rights of war; for, this would be taking a decided part with the enemy.\nOn the conquest of Dominica a capitulation took place, and by that capitulation, a commercial intercourse between Great Britain and that Island was prohibited: The object was to weaken the power of Great Britain, by lessening her naval and commercial resources. But what has been the conduct of the Brig and the Imperial subjects her owners ? Kender Mason, a British subject, establishes a plan at Ostend, by which the commerce of Great Britain with Dominica is to be kept up and preserved, thro\u2019 the intervention of that port. On this plan Liebert, Beas, Dardine & Co. Imperial subjects, purchase at London the Brig Erstern: Kender Mason puts on board a cargo of British merchandize, the property of British subjects : The Brig clears out from London, ostensibly for Ostend, and there arrives: Liebert, Beas, Dardine & Co. supply her with false and colourable papers, assume upon themselves the ownership of the cargo, and dress it up in the garb of neutrality, to screen it from detention and capture: The Brig then clears out for Dominica, and sails for that Island with the cargo she took on board at London.\nCan such conduct consist with neutrality? Can there be a more flagrant violation of it? Does it not aim to wrest, from France and the United States, the advantages they acquired by the conquest of Dominica: And does it not evince a fraudulent combination with British subjects, and a palpable partiality?\nBut, \u201c why shall the rights of neutrality be broke by works of supererogation? If the cargo was British property, unprotected by the capitulation, it was then the property of enemies, and as it did not consist of contraband articles, it was protected from capture, by the ordinance of Congress: The Brig, therefore, needed not to employ fraud and stratagem to give it the garb of neutrality, in order to screen it from capture.\u201d\nIf the offence, which the Brig has committed, consisted in employing fraud and stratagem, merely to protect property which belonged to an enemy, the objection might, in consequence of the ordinance of Congress, be of some force. But the offence is not of so limited a nature; it is far more extensive, and comprehends a flagrant violation of the rights of neutrality: It results from a fraudulent combination with British subjects, to give weight and energy to the arms of Great Britain, by the re-establishment of a commerce, and its emoluments, which she had lost by the conquest of Dominica.\nBut, it is objected, \u201c The cargo is not prize, because it is not contraband, and all the other effects and goods, tho\u2019 the property of an enemy, are exempted from capture by the ordinance of Congress.\u201d\nIf the Erstern had been employed in a fair commerce, such as was consistent with the rights of neutrality, her cargo, tho\u2019 the property of an enemy, could not be prize; because Congress have said, by their ordinance, that the rights of neutrality shall extend protection to such effects and goods of an enemy. But, if the rights of neutrality are violated, Congress have not said, that such a violated neutrality shall give such protection: \u201cNor could they have said so, without confounding all the distinctions between right and wrong.\nUpon the whole, we are of opinion, that the decree below be reversed, and that the said Brig and Cargo be condemned, as prize, for the use of the captors, without costs.", "author": "BY THE COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Darby, et. al.

Brice engaged to serve in the capacity of first, lieutenant, and Woodroff, as surgeon to the ship, which was an armed letter of marque. By these articles Brice was to receive \u00a318 and Woodroff \u00a317 per month. At this time it was war between Great Britain and the United States of America. The ship fell down the river in order to commence her voyage, but' from various causes of delay, did not clear the Capes, so as to enter on the high seas before the 20th of March following. In the mean time, viz. on the 3d of March, peace had taken place, and hostilities ceased between the belligerent powers. Whereupon, it has been alleged in behalf of the respondents, that \u00a35 per month are the customary wages in time of peace, and a full recompence for services for navigating a ship; that all above that sum is allowed in consideration of the risk and dangers of war. That the consideration failing, and no risk being incurred, as peace had taken place before the ship had entered on the field of danger, the extraordinary wages ought to abate, and that the libellants ought to be content with peace wages for services done in time of peace.\nOn the contrary, it has been urged, that the contract was duly and regularly made: that contracts are sacred things, and ought to be taken entire, and strictly construed: that contracting parties should not be admitted to explain their intentions afterwards, or recede from the terms of their bargain, on account of future contingencies, provided there was no fraud in the case: that the performance of the voyage, and doing the duty on board, are the true consideration of the wages: that whether these wages are high or low is a matter that should have been considered when the contract was made: that as it cannot be supposed, that if the danger had been greatly increased by the arrival from an enemy\u2019s fleet on the coast, or from any other circumstance, the owners would have, allowed increased wages, neither ought they to diminish the wages, because the danger happened to be lessened by the intervention of peace. And lastly, that the voyage was actually commenced when the ship left the port, although she remained long after in the river.\nThe advanced wages above what is customary in time of peace is in consideration of the risk and dangers incident to war: in the present ease it is clear that both parties, when they made the contract, had war in view, as is evident from the stations the libellants were to fill, viz. the one, that of first lieutenant, and the other, that of surgeon of the ship, offices unknown on board of merchantmen in time of peace. Whether it would indeed be peace or war, was a circumstance out of the reach of the parties to command. Peace, however, did take place, seventeen days before any risk whatever was incurred on account of the war. The case of insurance cited from 3 Burrows, 1237, is a leading case in point The contract there was regularly made between parties, more competent to be strictly bound than common mariners, viz. the owners of a ship and the underwriters, and yet it was determined by all the judges, that this.contract ought to be liberally construed; and that the insurance premium should be returned for such part of the voyage as had run no risk.\nThe cause lately decided in this court, McCulloch v. Lethe [Case No. 8,738], has been quoted; but there is a manifest and essential difference between that case and the present. In the former, the libellant had actually incurred the risk, had subjected himself to be killed in battle, or taken prisoner, which was the real consideration of the war wages promised; in the present case no risk from war was at all incurred: for, although much pains had been taken to shew, that the captain and crew of the Nancy, not having heard of the peace, had sufficient reason to think that it was war when they sailed, and conducted themselves accordingly; yet the question is not, what might have been their apprehensions, but what was the reality of the danger, or whether it was indeed war or peace at the time? Had this vessel advanced into the scene of danger, though but for twenty-four hours before peace had taken effect, I should have no doubt in allowing the libellants their full wages, according to the articles, upon the same principles on which wages were decreed to McCulloch.\nThat the common law doctrines respecting contracts do not apply in all their strictness to cases maritime is evident from the constant practice of this court. The enlistment of mariners has neither the complexion nor the formalities required by the rules of common law; and it would be hard to bind men so ignorant as common mariners generally are, to the legal construction of terms, nor would it be for the interest of mariners, that articles should be so strictly construed, as the operation would probably be frequently much against them. It appears, that when the libellants entered on board the Nancy, it was actual war, and that they held themselves in readiness to do the services, and encounter the dangers for which the stipulated wages had been promised. It was not their fault that the vessel did not forthwith proceed on her voyage. I see therefore no reason against their being allowed full wages for that period, and the common usage is to allow mariners their wages from the time of signing the articles, let the vessel sail when she may.\nI adjudge that the libellants have and receive their full wages, according to contract, from the time of signing the articles, to the 3d of March last; and that they receive customary peace wages from the said 3d of March, to the completion of the voyage.", "author": "HOPKINSON, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "State Admiralty Court, Pennsylvania.\nBRICE et al. v.

PITCAIRN et al."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "THOMPSON, Circuit Justice.\nFrom this statement of the case it is very clear that none of the plaintiff\u2019s funds have, in point of fact, come into the hands of the defendants, and if they are to be made responsible for the loss occasioned by the failure of Williams, it ought to be thrown upon them by reason of some well-settled rule of law. This letter of credit given by the defendants to the plaintiff, did not create any debt or contract between the immediate parties to it, for the payment of a sum of money direct; it was only an authority to create a debt by a draft on the defendants, and an engagement on their part to accept and pay such draft. The defendants, therefore, stand in the character of sureties or guarantors of the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s drafts to the extent of the credit given, if the plaintiff choose to avail himself of it. If A. should give to B. a letter of credit upon a mercantile house, for goods to a given amount, and B. did not see fit to avail himself of it, this would surely not give him any cause of action against A., and it could make no difference whether A. had collateral security given to him or not. From the nature of such transactions it must necessarily rest in the discretion of the person who receives the letter of credit, whether he will avail himself of it or not; he may, therefore, relinquish or abandon the authority or right which he had to use the credit given him by such letter. The letter of credit is given to enable the party receiving it to contract a debt with some third person, under the guaranty of the person giving the letter. The bill drawn by the plaintiff, after his return to Boston, and with full knowledge of the failure of Williams, cannot affect the rights of the present parties, or alter the nature of this transaction; this was evidently done as a mere matter of form. There is nothing to warrant the conclusion that the drawers took this bill upon the credit of the defendants\u2019 letter, or that any consideration was paid for it; and, indeed, the action itself shows that the interest of no third party is involved in the transaction.\nThe question then resolves itself into the inquiry whether the plaintiff had not, before Re heard o\u00ed the failure of 'Williams, so far relinquished all right to avail himself of this letter of credit, as to preclude him from throwing the loss upon the defendants. The letter, upon its face, assumes to guarantee the plaintiff\u2019s drafts, on account of the credit opened by Williams; and his letter to the defendants shows that the credit which the plaintiff wanted was at Stralsund.\n4\nThe undertaking of the defendants was, therefore, to give the plaintiff such credit at that place, and not at any other place where he might see fit to draw or make his bills payable. This might have been a matter of some importance to them; and if they stand in the character of sureties, they have a right to claim a strict compliance with their engagement. But, independent of this, it is very clear, from the evidence, that this credit was to be used at Stralsund, and if not used there, it was not to be used at all.\nThe defendants\u2019 letter to the plaintiff, of the 7th of November, shows very satisfactorily that such was the understanding of the parties; and this letter being introduced by the plaintiff, is competent evidence for the defendants, so far as it makes in their favor as -well as against them. They there say: \u201cYou informed us you should not require the letter of credit after you went to Paris, whence you would draw direct\u201d That is, direct on Williams. This fact, as also this construction of the letter, is fully corroborated by that of the plaintiff to Williams of the 21st of August, at Stralsund, where, he says, he had presented his letter of credit to the defendants for a partial payment of \u00a3150; and that, if he should be in want of funds on the continent, he should draw direct on him (Williams). If the plaintiff had supposed that his funds, to the amount of \u00a3400, had been transferred from \"Vyilliams to the defendants, where the necessity or propriety of their writing him? This letter will not admit of the construction that he should draw on account of other funds which he had in Williams\u2019 hands; for, if that had been the case, it was altogether irrelevant and unimportant to state that he had only drawn for a partial payment on the defendants. This letter admits of no other reasonable interpretation than that he had drawn on the defendants for \u00a3150, and that for the residue of the \u00a3400, he should draw direct on him, (Williams,) and not circuitously through the defendants, if he should want any more funds on the continent. After this letter, Williams could not have transferred these funds to the defendants, and thereby exonerated himself from payment to the plaintiff. Williams had in no way become absolutely responsible to the defendants for the amount of the \u00a3400. He had engaged to become security or responsible for advances to the plaintiff to that amount; but until such advances were made, or the defendants had made themselves answerable therefor, they could have no claim upon Williams; he had only authorized them to draw on him for reimbursement, which necessarily presupposes advances to have been made by them to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had undoubtedly a right to waive or relinquish the benefit or use of this letter of credit; and whether he had done so or not was submitted to the jury; and I see no ground upon which that verdict ought to be disturbed. Motion for a new trial denied.\n4 In England it seems to be at this time questionable whether a party who advances money upon a general letter of credit can sustain an action upon it. Russell v. Wiggin [Case No. 12,165]; Bank of Ireland v. Archer, 11 Mees. & W. 383. The reason assigned is, that there is no privity of contract between them. It is there assumed that it is only a contract between the drawer of the letter and the person for whose benefit it is drawn. But in this country the contrary doctrine is well settled. Letters-of \u2022credit are of two kinds, general and special. A special letter of credit is addressed to a particular individual by name, and is confined to him, and gives no other person a right to act upon it. A general letter, on the contrary, is addressed to any and every person, and, therefore, gives any person to whom it may be shown, authority to ad vance upon its credit. A privity of contract springs up between him and the drawer of the letter, and it becomes in legal effect the same as if addressed to h>m by name. Russell v. Wiggin [supra]; 12 Mass. 154; 2 Metc. [Mass.] 381; 12 Wend. 393; [Adams v. Jones] 12 Pet. [37 U. S.] 207; Birckhead v. Brown, 5 Hill, 641; Story, Bills. See Beam. Lex. Mer. 444. But these general letters of credit may be subdivided into two kinds, those that contemplate a single transaction, and those that contemplate an open and continued credit, embracing several transactions. In the latter case they are not generally confined to transactions with a single individual; but if the nature of the business which the letter of credit was intended to facilitate, requires it, different individuals are authorized to make ad vances upon it. and it then becomes a several contract with each individual to the amount advanced by him. Thus a general letter of credit may be issued to a person to enable him to purchase goods in the city of New York, for a country store. The very nature of the business requires him to deal with different individuals and houses, in order to obtain the necessary assortment. It has never, as I am aware, been questioned that the guarantor might be bound to several persons who should furnish goods upon the credit of the letter. So letters are issued by commission houses in the city, to enable persons to purchase produce in the Western states. The money is obtained from the local banks in those states by drafts drawn upon those houses, and upon the faith of the letters of credit. It may often happen that a single bank cannot furnish the requisite amount, or it may be necessary to use the money in different and distant localities. I am not aware of any question ever having been \u00edaised as to the authority of different banks to act upon the same letter of credit. It is absolutely necessary that such should be the effect of them, in order to facilitate the commerce of the country, and to carry out the object of the parties in issuing the letters of credit. Birckhead v. Brown, 5 Hill. 641; Russell v. Wiggin [supra]. Pratt, J., delivering the opinion of the court in Union Bank v. Coster, 3 Comst. [3 N. Y.] 203.\nLetters of credit usually contain a request that some one will advance money, or sell goods to a third person, and an undertaking on the part \u2022of the writer that the debt which may be con-traeted by the third person in pursuance of the request shall be duly paid. These letters have been divided into two classes, general and special. They are general when addressed to any and all persons, without naming any one in particular. They are special when addressed to a particular individual or firm by name. When the letter is addressed to all persons, it is in effect a request made to each and every one of them, and any individual may accept and act upon the proposition contained in it; and on his doing so, that which was before indefinite and at large, becomes definite and fixed: a contract immediately springs up between the person making the advance and the writer of the letter, and it is thenceforward the same thing in legal effect as though the name of the former had been inserted in the letter at the beginning. I can see no difficulty in this, for there is plainly, a privity of contract between the parties. Watson v. McLaren, 19 Wend. 557, and 26 Wend. 425, in error; Boyce v. Edwards, 4 Wheat. [17 U. S.] 111; Adams v. Jones, 12 Pet. [37 U. S.] 207; Lawrason v. Mason, 3 Cranch [7 U. S.] 492: Bradley v. Cary, 8 Greenl. 234; Russell v. Wiggin [supra]; and same case cited in Story, Bills, 546. note. And see Carnegie v. Morrison, 2 Metc. [Mass.] 381. When the letter is special, or, in other words, addressed to . a particular individual, he alone has the right to act upon and acquire rights under it. If any one else attempts to accept and act upon the proposition contained in the letter, he comes in as a mere volunteer, and he cannot by thus thrusting himself forward create any legal obligation on the part of the writer. There has been no communication, and is no privity of contract between them. Robbins v. Bingham, 4 Johns. 476; Walsh v. Bailie, 10 Johns. 180.\nIn Russell v. Wiggin [supra] and cited in Story, Bills, 546. note, the defendants gave a letter of credit to Breed, by which they engaged to honor the bills which might be drawn in India by Breed\u2019s agent.. The agent drew bills on the defendants, which the plaintiffs took on the faith of the letter. The defendants refused to accept when the bills were presented, and the plaintiffs thereupon sued and recovered on the letter of credit. Mr. Justice Story went mainly upon the ground that the letter amounted to a virtual acceptance of the bills. If that be so. and the action had been brought upon the bills themselves, there could be no gpod objection to the recovery. But I should find 'great difficulty in saying that the plaintiffs could sue on the letter of credit, for the reason that they were not parties to it. I should agree with the four eminent English barristers who gave their opinion that by the law of England the action would not lie. because there was no privity of contract between the parties. But it is not necessary to pass upon that question, for here the defendants never agreed with any one that they would accept and pay bills. They only requested Brown & Oo. to accept, and undertook to keep them indemnified. That was not a negotiable promise upon which the plaintiffs can sue. The case of Carnegie v. Morrison, 2 Metc. [Mass.] 381. stands much upon the same principle with the one which has just been noticed.", "author": "THOMPSON, Circuit Justice.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Circuit Court, D.

PITCAIRN et al.\nThis was a motion for a new trial on the ground of misdirection in the charge of the court to the jury-\n3\nThe material facts in the cause were briefly these: The plaintiff [Henry Lienow] having in the hands of Samuel Williams, of London, funds to the amount of five hundred pounds sterling, and having occasion for money at Hamburgh and elsewhere in his travels upon the continent, procured from Williams a letter of credit, dated 14th July, 1825, addressed to the defendants [Pitcairn & Brodie] at Hamburgh, requesting them to furnish the plaintiff with money, at Hamburgh, and a credit at Stralsund to the extent of four hundred pounds, and to draw upon him (Williams) for their reimbursement. This letter of credit was presented by the plaintiff to the defendants, upon which they advanced to him \u00a3150, and gave him a letter of credit on themselves, dated the 28th July, 1825, at Hamburgh, in which they say: \u201cWe hereby accredit you with us to the extent of three thousand six hundred and six marks and twelve shillings, Hamburg Ban-co, for which sum, or any part, your drafts on us will meet ready honor, on account of the credit opened you with us by our mutual friend, Samuel Williams, of London.\u201d The plaintiff, by a letter dated the 21st August, 1825, at Stralsund, addressed to Samuel Williams, informed him that he should leave there the next day for Southern Germany, and mentioning that he had presented his (Williams\u2019) letter of credit on the defendants for the partial payment of \u00a3150, for which he gave his receipt; and that if he should be in want of funds on the continent, he should draw upon him (Williams). The plaintiff, after his arrival at Paris, and on \u25a0 the 30th of October, 1825, wrote to the defendants that he had seen by the public papers that Williams had failed; and referring to their letter of credit of the 28th of July, informed them that he should shortly be in want of funds, and should avail himself of his credit on them. The answer to this letter, dated the 7th of November, 1825, (which was introduced in evidence on the part of the plaintiff,) contained the following statement: \u201cMr. Williams\u2019 letter of credit, to which ours referred, was for a credit at Stralsund, and money here, (Hamburgh;) the latter we furnished, and the former you informed us would not be required after you went to Paris, whence you would draw direct. His (Williams\u2019) failure annuls all credit opened on his account, and we are sorry to be obliged to say we cannot accept any of your bills.\u201d The plaintiff, after his return to Boston, on the 9th of January, 1820, drew on the defendants for three thousand six hundred and six marks and twelve shillings, Ham-burgh Banco, in favor of Messrs. Godeffray & Son, which the defendants refused to accept. Upon this evidence the court below charged the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.\nCase Ho. 8,341.\nBills and Notes \u2014 Letter of Credit \u2014 Guarantor.\n1. A letter of credit given by the writer of the letter on himself, as an accommodation, does not create any debt or contract between the immediate parties to it, for the payment of a sum of money direct; but is only an authority to create a debt by a draft on the party giving it, and an engagement on his part to accept and pay such draft. The latter stands in the character of surety or guarantor for the payment of drafts to the extent of the credit given, if the former chooses to avail himself of it.\n2. If the person receiving the letter of credit decline to avail himself of it. it will be a waiver and abandonment of the credit given.\n3.

And it has been urged in support of the libel, that every contract of the captain, for necessaries for a ship, implies an hypothecation, and induces a lien on the ship in favour of the creditor, suable in the admiralty by the rules of civil law. And the case principally relied upon as authority for this doctrine, is cited from Cowp. p. 630.\nThe case referred to is a suit at common law, brought by a ropemaker, against the owners of a ship, for ropes furnished to the captain; the plaintiff having charged Har-wood (the captain) and the owners of the ship for the ropes, without naming or knowing who the owners were. The fact was, that the owners, according to the custom of the county of Essex, in England, where they probably resided, had leased the ship to Har-wood for a term of years, on certain conditions: and the questions were, whether, under these circumstances, Harwood was not both captain and owner, during the term? and whether the original owners ought to be responsible for debts contracted on account of the ship whilst in the possession of Har-wood, under the lease? Lord Mansfield was of opinion, that neither the lease, nor the ignorance of the creditor, as to the names or persons of the owners, could exonerate them. And to shew that the owners are bound, he says \u2014 \u201cSuppose the ship had been impounded in the admiralty, and that had happened at the end of the term, the owners could not have had their ship, without paying the debt for which she had been impounded.\u201d But this case is brought into view chiefly because Lord Mansfield, in giving his opinion, observes, that the creditor had three securities for his debt, viz. the person of the captain with whom he contracted, the specific ship, and the owners. It should be remembered, however, that this was a suit at common law: that the owners, the ship, the captain, the creditor, and the contract, were all within the realm; and there can be no doubt but that the creditor might have his action at law either against the persons of the contractors, or might attach their property, the ship, for his debt.\nBut this case has no reference whatever to the maritime or civil law. The doctrine of hypothecation is never once mentioned, nor is the contract of the captain at all placed upon \u2022that ground. The principal object was, to determine whether the lease of the ship did not exonerate the lessors during the term. So, in the case cited from 1 Yes., Sr., 154. This also was purely a common law process; wherein the parties and the whole transaction appear to have been infra corpus comi-tatus. \u201cCertainly,\u201d says the lord chancellor, \u201cby the maritime law the master has power \u2022to hypothecate the ship during the voyage, and from the necessity of the case; but it is different where the ship is infra corpus comi-tatus, and the contract made by the owners or master on land, and not arising from necessity \u2014 then, the laws of the land must prevail.\u201d And this is clearly consonant with the whole current of authorities respecting the doctrine of hypothecation, viz. that it must be made during the voyage, and from the necessity of the case. When money is borrowed on the ship, before the voyage began. the ship is not answerable in the admiralty, 1 Ld. Raym. 578. So,\u2019in 2 Ld. liaym. 9S2, in the ease of Johnson v. Shippen, Chief Justice Holt says \u2014 \u201cIf a ship be hypothecated before a voyage begin, that is not a matter within the jurisdiction of the admiralty; for it is a contract made here, and the owners can give security to perform the-contract.\u201d It appears, then, to be a settled doctrine, that a ship cannot be hypothecated, according to the maritime law, before the voyage is begun, or in places where the owners reside, even for those necessaries, without which the ship could not proceed to sea. The law means to favour the completion, not the commencement of a voyage. For this reason, the legislature of Pennsylvania hath, by a special act, given to the artificers who build or repair, and to those who furnish necessaries to fit out a ship for sea, a lien upon the vessel, suable in the admiralty, before the voyage is begun, because the maritime law does not extend to their security.\nSince, then, it appears that the advance of moneys to fit out the ship Enterprize, was made before the commencement of her voyage, and not from necessity; and that the captain, the owners, or some of them, and the contractors, were all within the state at the time of the transaction; and as the suit is not brought under the act of assembly of the 27th of March, 1784, I cannot admit this case to be of admiralty jurisdiction, and, therefore, I adjudge that the bill be dismissed. and that the libellants pay the costs of suit.", "author": "HOPKINSON, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court.

Judgment:\nThis is a suit brought on a bottomry bond given by John Walsh to the libellants at Ostend, whereby he hypothecates the ship Emperor, of which he was then the captain, for 4500 florins, equal to \u00a3409. Is. 9d. sterling money of Great Britain, advanced for repairs of the said ship. Whereupon James Oellers, the owner of this ship, and others his assignees, come in and answer to the libel, alleging that this bot-tomry bond ought not to take effect as an hypothecation, according to the maritime law. The power vested in a master of a vessel to impawn his owner\u2019s ship or goods for necessaries furnished in a foreign port, is\n1\na legal indulgence founded on the urgency of the case, and for the general benefit of commerce. There are few rules of law more strictly defined than this of hypothecation, and none in which the reason and intention of the law are more manifest. It is thus delineated: \u201cA master of a ship hath no power to take up money by bottomry, in places where his owner or owners dwell.\u201d \u201cBut when a master is out of the country, and where he hath no owners, nor any goods of their\u2019s, nor of his own, and cannot find means to take up by exchange or otherwise, and that for want of money the voyage might be retarded or overthrown, moneys may be taken up upon bottomry.\u201d Moll, de J. Mar. bk. 2, c. 11, \u00a7 11. \u201cAnd the money so taken up by the master, is done upon great extremity, and that for the completing of the voyage, when they are in distress and want in some foreign parts.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12. All the books agree in the spirit of this doctrine. The extreme necessity appears, every where, to be the reason of the law, and the intention, to favour commerce.\nLet us now take a view of the circumstances of the present case. The leading facts appear, from the testimony exhibited, to be these: The ship Emperor, John Walsh master, belonging to James Oellers of Philadelphia, sailed for Ostend with a cargo of tobacco on board; the ship and cargo being consigned by the owner to Bine, Overman and Co. merchants at Ostend. This ship was so damaged by a storm at sea, that the captain was obliged to put into the port of Dover, in England, in distress. The captain on his arrival at Dover, immediately sent notice of his situation to the consignees at Ostend, and they speedily furnished him with a credit on London, from which he raised money sufficient to refit his ship. After this, he sailed for and arrived at Ostend, where the consignees took charge of the ship and cargo. Before the v'essel arrived at Ostend, Bine, Overman and Co. had accepted bills, to a considerable amount, drawn upon them by Oellers, on the credit of this consignment. Upon closing all accounts, Bine, Overman and Co. found that Oellers had .not only drawn upon them to the full amount of the cargo and freight (\u201cthe tobacco not selling so well as was expected\u201d), but that there remained a considerable balance in their favour. To secure this balance, they tell Captain Walsh that he shall not leave the port, and even threaten to attach the ship, unless he will repay them the moneys advanced at Dover for repairs, or hypothecate the ship, for security. It was not in Captain Walsh\u2019s power to do the one, that is, to repay the money, and he declined the other proposal for some time. But finding expenses accumulating, and that he could not sail without some accommodation, he at last consented to hypothecate the ship. Bine, Overman and Co. then recommended him to Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. telling him that they would lend money on bottomry; and conducted him to their house, where he executed the bottomry bond, now in question. But no money was paid to Walsh; for the bills for repairs, for which the ship was hypothecat-ed, had long since been discharged by the produce of the credit on London. After this, Bine, Overman and Co. permitted Captain Walsh to sail, and in due time he arrived in the port of Philadelphia. During these transactions, Oellers had failed, and assigned this ship to his creditors, and the question now is, whether this bottomry bond shall operate to the exclusive security of the merchants at Ostend against all other creditors, as a genuine hypothecation would do, on the principles of maritime law.\nAfter a careful consideration of these circumstances, I cannot discover one real feature of that rule of law, which should be the ground of the present suit. True it is that the ship was in necessity, and so is every ship that wants essential repairs. But the owner had credit within reach. The consignees were not far distant. The application was easy and certain, and the consignees no sooner heard of the disaster but they furnished the means of relief. In fact, Bine, Overman and Co. had the strongest inducements to exert themselves in getting the ship repaired at Dover, to enable her to get round to Ostend, for they had made themselves answerable for Oellers\u2019 bills, upon the credit of this cargo; it was, therefore, of great importance to them that the cargo should arrive safe to their hands. So that, instead of advancing money to a distressed stranger, they were only taking care of their own security. This motive is manifested by their letter to Walsh at Dover, and still further by their subsequent conduct; for, after they had disposed of the cargo, and found a balance due from Oellers to them, they insist that Walsh shall not sail unless he will hypothecate the ship to Liebart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. which, from all appearances, seems to be the same thing as hypoth-ecating her to themselves. For the captain received no money from Liebart, Baes, Dur-deyn and Co. who were not at all interested in the transaction, and whose names were only made use of to save appearances; for Bine, Overman and Co. well knew that, being consignees, the captain had no power to hypothecate the vessel to them. And, in order to give the bottomry bond the appearance of a genuine hypothecation, they select from the general account the moneys spent in repairs at Dover, and compel the captain to hypothecate the ship, as for those particular charges, to the libellants, who had not advanced one shilling towards that expense. Further, if we look into the accounts we shall find, that although this voyage was not a very successful one, yet the ship cleared all charges accrued since she sailed from Philadelphia, even including the repairs at Dover. But Oellers had drawn upon Bine, Overman and Co. on the credit of the future voyage, long before the vessel sailed from Philadelphia, to raise money to fit her out, and it is these drafts brought into account which make a balance due to the consignees. So that, instead of an hypothecation made to enable a ship to complete her voyage, it was, in fact, made to enable her owner to begin one. Which was never the object of the maritime law in cases of hypothecation. Neither was this law ever designed to give partial advantages in mercantile connexions, or intended to secure the balance of a running account between owners and consignees.\nThe importance of the present decision to the commercial character of our country has been strongly urged, in favour of the libel-lants. But I am not apprehensive on this account. The question in view is not to be determined by any municipal law of the country, but by a general law, universally received and understood. And I am of opinion, that our national character would much more suffer by an adjudged precedent, which might open a door for dangerous collusions, by putting it in the power of captains of vessels to saddle their owners with unnecessary engagements, or to give an unfair advantage to foreign creditors, by a fraudulent use of that preeminent lien which the law lays on a ship and goods properly hypoth-ecated. I do not mean to suggest that there has been any fraud or collusion in the present case. It is enough that I do not find the claim of the libellants within the spirit or intention of the maritime law. And, therefore, I adjudge that the bill be dismissed, and that the libellants pay the costs of suit.\nFrom this decision there was an appeal to the high court of errors and appeals. The cause was again argued there, but the judgment of the court of admiralty was confirmed. The following notes, taken at the time, contain the substance of the judgment given in the high court of errors and appeals in the above cause:\n\u2022\u2018October 3, 1785. The court observed, that the power of a master to hypothecate his owner\u2019s ship was a necessary, but sometimes a dangerous power: the court was unwilling to extend this power farther than the law strictly authorized. A genuine hypothe-cation ought to be the voluntary act of the master at the time when, and in the place where, the moneys were advanced for necessaries or repairs. The money advanced ought to be solely on the faith of the hypoth-ecation, and not on any personal credit. These are incontrovertible principles \u2014 the present case not applicable to them. Although the hypothecation was made to Lie-bart, Baes, Durdeyn and Co. yet it was to secure moneys advanced by Bine, Overman and Co. the consignees. No authority shewn, and none can be shewn, because none ought to be, that an hypothecation can be made to a consignee: great mischiefs might arise if captains could hypothecate to consignees. No authority produced to prove that an hypoth-ecation can be made in any port but that in which the vessel first arrives after the distress and damage sustained. Bine, Over-man and Co. did not repair the vessel on the faith of the hypothecation; but this hypothe-cation was made to secure to consignees the balance of a running account.

If the appeal should be admitted, it must be on this principle, that there had been such irregularities in the proceedings, as that justice and right required, that the cause should be re-heard, in order to do that justice here, which had not been done in the Court below. The irregularity suggested is, that the captors did not bring, or send, the matter of the captured vessel, in order to be enquired of touching the property, &c. nor produce the documents mentioned by the matter, in his protest; and that, for want thereof, a condemnation had taken place. However blamable the captor may have been, in omitting to send, or bring the master before the Admiralty Court, and in not producing those documents, such omission alone is not sufficient to set aside the decree and re-hear the cause, unless it appeared that substantial justice has been thereby prevented. In this case, upon an examination of all the evidence produced, it appears that the condemnation of the Sloop Chester must have taken place, if the same evidence had been offered in the Admiralty Court. Peter Theodore Vantylengen appears to have been a merchant in a British settlement, on the Bay of Honduras; not barely having a transient residence, but carrying on trade from that settlement, like other inhabitants. It is not material to whom his natural allegiance was due; he was enjoying the privileges, and subject to the inconveniences of other merchants, residing in the same place. The Sloop Chester appears to have been a British vessel, possefied of British papers, purchased by Vantylengen, and employed by him; and although he might have executed the Bill of Sale of her, to certain subjects of the United Netherlands, with whom the United States were at peace and amity, for the purpose, as he expresses it, of preventing her being taken, such a transfer cannot be considered as bona fide ; but, from the tenor of the instructions of said Vantylengen, to the master of the Sloop, that transfer appears to have been intended merely to deceive and cover, under the name of a friend, property which ought to be considered as that of an enemy. Examining the protest made by the master of the Sloop Chester, it does not appear, that he was prevented by the captors from going to Charleston; but on the contrary, his going on shore at St. Eustatia, upon the privateer\u2019s leaving that place, seems to have been in consequence of his own solicitation.

The one founded on an hy-pothecation of the said vessel, made by the then captain to Santiago Cupisono at Ha-vannah, for 200 dollars advanced by the said Cupisono for necessaries for the said brigantine, as it is said, and to enable her to prosecute her voyage; which instrument of hy-pothecation is endorsed or assigned over by the lender to the present libellant: and the other, founded on a written contract between the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, then captain, and Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, made at Havannah, respecting the wages he should receive for serving as pilot and mariner on board the said brigantine, in her voyage from Havannah to Philadelphia. As these' claims arise from different contracts, it is manifest that they must be separately considered.\nTo determine on the force of this instrument of bottomry, I shall first state the circumstances necessary to the formation of a genuine hypothecation, according to the maritime law; and then take a view of the history of this vessel\u2019s voyage, and her situation at the Havannah, when Cupisono advanced the money in question. As to the first, I have had occasion, in three former suits in this court, to state the doctrine respecting a maritime hypothecation, and have not since found reason to alter my opinion of the principles on which these causes were decided. The cases to which I refer were Liebart v. The Emperor [Case No. 8,340], Turnbull v. The Enterprize [Id. 14,242], and Forbes v. The Hannah [Id. 4,925]. The first and third of these causes were carried into the high court of errors and appeals, were there again solemnly argued and considered, and, without the intervention of any new testimony to alter the case, the sentences of the admiralty were confirmed on the same, or nearly the same, principles. I can only now repeat the substance of what was then observed. (Here the judge recapitulated the doctrines advanced, and the authorities cited in the three foregoing causes, and then proceeded to say:)\n\u201cI shall now state the history of the voyage of this brigantine, as the same may be deduced from the testimony exhibited.\n5\nIt appears, that this vessel was chartered on account of the Ring of Spain, and was to sail from Philadelphia with a cargo of flour for Carthagena; that the flour was there to be sold, and a cargo of dye-wood purchased and brought back to Philadelphia, or some port of the United States. Such was the designated voyage. But. it seems, the captain, instead of returning to Philadelphia from Carthagena, went to Jamaica with an adventure of his own; to what amount does not appear. That at Jamaica he purchased dry goods fit for the Havannah market, and then sailed with the brig to Havannah, where he disposed of the goods he had bought at Jamaica, on his own account.' That at Havannah he borrowed 200 dollars of Cupisono, and executed the instrument called an hypothecation, to engage the vessel and her freight to Cupisono as security for this sum. That part of this money was expended in paying wages to the sailors, and part in supplying them with fresh provisions. That the vessel was refitted at the king\u2019s arsenal, and at the expense of the intendant. And that she afterwards sailed for and arrived at the port of Philadelphia. I agree with the counsel for the libellant, that the validity of an hypothecation ought not to depend upon the regularity of the captain\u2019s conduct with respect to his owners, previous to the time of her arrival in a foreign port, and of lending money for the relief of the ship\u2019s necessities; and will go farther, and say, that neither ought it to be affected by the captain\u2019s subsequent conduct, provided the lender was in no ways privy to, or knowingly assistant in, his obliquities.\nIt has been urged on the other side, that the law of hypothecation was designed solely for the benefit of the owners, and an inference drawn, that if it can be shewn that the owners of a vessel have not been benefited, but injured, by the captain\u2019s conduct and consequent hypothecation, it ought not to be allowed. But this law has for its object the good of commerce in general. And no stranger would lend money on hypothecation, if his lien on the ship was to be invalidated by some future proof that the voyage was irregular, or that the captain had deviated from the orders of his owners and injured their interests, either before or after the hypothecation made. But where shall we find, in the present case, that necessity which should justify the captain\u2019s conduct, and be the ground of a genuine hypothecation? This vessel was chartered by the king of Spain or his agent, the cargo on board was on the king's account, and she arrives in a leaky and disabled condition in one of his majesty\u2019s ports, where he had an officer stationed. This officer, the intendant, orders the brig to the public warehouse to be discharged, and then round to hie king\u2019s arsenal to be repaired; all which was done at the king\u2019s expense. In truth, I cannot conceive a case of less necessity, or one wherein a more certain and able relief could be depen Jed upon.\nBut, it is said, there were considerable delays before the intendant interfered, and that the captain was obliged to send in five or six memorials, and in the mean time the mariners were in great want of wages and fresh provisions, and that in this necessity the captain applied to Cupisono for 200 dollars, who refused to lend them unless the vessel should be hypothecated for his security. It appears, however, by the deposition, that the money was lent by Cupisono before the captain had made any application at all to the intendant, and therefore the neglect of the intendant could not have occasioned the necessity of borrowing money from Cupisono. That the captain of a vessel in the king's service, and in one of his majesty\u2019s ports, should not have credit for a few days' provisions, until the proper officer could bo applied to, is too incredible to be seriously admitted. Still less can it be a sufficient ground for an hypothecation, that the mariners must have wages paid to them, in a place where it does not appear that any wages wore due. nor is it probable that any could be due, because this was neither the conclusion of the voyage, nor even a port of delivery. The- money ought to have been lent solely on the faith of the hypothecation, and not on any personal credit; but here was a strong and well founded credit, for it is in testimony that Cupisono knew that this brig was chartered for the king's service, and it is expressly said, that the money was borrowed to pay wages and procure fresh provisions until money could be had from the intendant\nFurther, in the quotation from Molloy, b-ii. c. 11. s. 11. it is said: \u201cWhen a master is out of the country, and where he hath no-owners, nor any goods of theirs, nor of his own,\u201d &c. Now it \u25a0 is confest that the captain had property of his own, and, as it should seem, to a considerable amount, since it was sufficient to induce him to violate his duty to his owners, in taking the brig, contrary to their orders,\n6\non a trading voyage to Jamaica for his own benefit; that at Jamaica he bought goods suitable for the Havan-nah market, and actually sold them at Hav-annah, though contraband \u2014 -and that Cupiso-no, the lender, was privy to these circumstances. So that, instead of the lender\u2019s having the brig alcne to look to for his security, he had two substantial persona-' credits to depend upon, viz. the intendan* from whom he might expect repayment of moneys advanced for the use of a vessel in the king\u2019s employ, and the captain, whose property he might have attached before he left the island, if satisfaction was not made. This circumstance alone, that is to say, Cupisono\u2019s knowledge that th\u00e9 captain had property of his own on the spot, sufficient to answer the present exigencies of the vessel, would have invalidated the bond as a maritime hypothecation, inasmuch as it removes that necessity which the law requires.\nThere is a circumstance in the present case, which, although not in itself conclusive, forms too striking a feature in the transaction to pass unnoticed. A singularity peculiar in a maritime hypothecation is, that the law allows an extraordinary premium or interest to the lender, even to any extent, according to the risk to be run; because, if the ship should be lost, the money lent is. lost with her. But here a stranger lends 200 dollars to a captain in distress, without even stipulating for common legal interest for the use of his money. I say, this alone might not be conclusive against the hypothecation, because a stranger may be as generous as be pleases; but, in connexion with the other circumstances, it gives room for suspicion that the engagement of the brig to Cupisono was not made within the rules and spirit of the maritime law. For the above reasons, I adjudge that the bill in this cause be dismissed, so far as the same hath respect to a claim of 200 dollars, said to have been lent on the credit of the brig Santissima Trinidad.\nI am now to consider the libellant\u2019s demand of wages for serving as pilot and mariner on board this vessel from Havannah to I-\u2019hiladelpliia. The counsel for the libellant hath rested his claim of \u00a3S7 5s. for wages, on a written contract made at the Havan-nah, between Fariseo Sanchez y Serna, then captain, and Ca\u00f1izares. But it has been contended, on the other side, that as this agreement is in writing, and bears a seal, and is not, according to the terms thereof, in the usual way of agreeing for mariners\u2019 wages, it becomes a special contract, and is not properly of admiralty jurisdiction. Its being in writing, however, is no more than a testimony or memorandum of the agreement made, and does not affect the jurisdiction of this court. What is called a seal, appears to be nothing more than a printed stamp, for which a duty is paid to the crown: certainly, it is not the seal of the parties, or of either of them. But, as to the terms of the contract, these are indeed out of the usual course, and deserve further consideration.\nOne of the reasons for allowing mariners to sue in the admiralty for their wages is, that the debt arises from services performed, or to be performed, at sea; and a lien on the ship is given them for security, because the contract they make is supposed to be on the credit of the ship. Now, although the wages of 20 dollars per month, promised in the present case, appear to be extravagant, yet as the difficulty of getting a person qualified to serve both as a skilful pilot and able mariner might have been great, I think the rate of wages per month ought to be allowed as contracted for. But I cannot, upon any principle, allow, that a captain hath a power to bind his owners and their vessel to the payment of a mariner\u2019s wages for three months after his discharge, and after all services at sea or elsewhere have ceased. If he could legally do this for three months, why not for six or for twelve months, or even saddle his owners with an annuity for life to a mariner, for a few weeks\u2019 actual service? How far the common law might consider this contract as binding on the captain personally, it is not my business to say; but, as judge of admiralty, I shall be far from doing my part towards establishing a precedent by which captains, in addition to the great power they necessarily have over the property of their employers, may have that of obliging them to the payment of unlimited sums for an unlimited time. The captain might have engaged for his owners, to pay wages per month during the service, or a specific sum for the run, to any amount justifiable by the circumstances and necessities of the case; but to bind the owner to periodical payments to a mariner, after a total discharge from the service, is what I believe no captain of a vessel ever before attempted. For, whether this was to be paid all at once, or at three several times, it matters not; the contract is for three months\u2019 wages after discharge.\nThere is another claim under this contract for CO dollars, to take the libellant back to the Havannah, on being discharged here. The maritime custom is, that if a master or owner, discharge a mariner in a foreign port, before the completion of the voyage for which he is engaged, some reasonable allowance shall be made, over and above the wages due, to enable him to return to his own country, or to go to the port which, by the articles, should have completed the voyage. And this allowance is usually the amount of one month\u2019s wages. And it is a reasonable custom, where the mariner is willing to perform articles and finish the voyage, but the master or owner thinks fit to discharge him sooner, for their own convenience, and without just cause of complaint against the mariner. This part of the contract before us is, therefore, consistent with maritime custom, but certainly unreasonable as to the sum promised. Whatever power a captain may have by law to bind his owners by contracts made abroad for the services of the ship, yet he cannot oblige them beyond what is usual and customary, without shewing that the unusual charge arose from tlie necessity of the case. The present charge is expressly made for conveying the libellant back to the Havannah. I have therefore inquired what is the usual charge for a passage from this port to the Havan-nah, and find that 40 dollars is an ample and generous allowance.\nFraud and collusion between the captain and Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, have been suggested, but not proved. let, if I had not found that this cause might and ought to be determined on general principles, there are two circumstances in the case which would have induced a more strict inquiry into this captain's conduct. The one, which I have already noticed, is Cupisono\u2019s lending money on hypothecation, without securing or even asking for common interest; which, though a possible, is not a usual occurrence. The other, is a contract between the captain and Ca\u00f1izares, which concludes with these remarkable words \u2014 \u201cEach,\u201d (that is, the original and copy) \u201chaving the same strength as if they had been executed before a notary public at Havannah.\u201d The question naturally occurs, and why was not this contract made and executed before a notary public 'at the Havannah? An honest captain, who is reduced to the necessity of binding his owners to hard and unusual terms, would at least take care that nothing should be wanting in point of form and public notoriety to justify his conduct. And, besides, 1 suspect that this contract, which bears a printed seal, or stamp, could not be legally executed, according to the regulations of the Spanish maritime laws and customs, but in the presence of a notary, or some public officer. But it was not necesary to clear up these appearances, as the cause may be decided on other grounds.\nUpon the whole, I adjudge and decree, that Ca\u00f1izares, the libellant, have and receive from Juan Joseph de Aguire Perez, the respondent, the sum of 112 dollars and G0-00ths of a dollar, equal to \u00a342 5s. Pennsylvania currency \u2014 that is to say\u2014\nFor five months and nineteen days\u2019 \u00a3. s. d. wages, from July 1st to December 19th, at twenty dollars per month.. 42 5 0\nFor his passage to the Havannah.. 15 0 0 \u00a9 IG lO\nO O o F* % *5 g n3 - \u00bf3 a a* o a u fa\nThere remains. 42 5 0\nWith respect to the \u00a35 12s.

Finally, I adjudge, that the libellant pay one half, and that the respondent pay the other half, of the costs and charges of this suit.\n5 There was but one deposition produced in this cause, viz. that of the late captain of the brig. It might have been a question, whether his testimony was legally admissible or not, but he was not objected to as a witness by the proctors for either side. His deposition was in these words: \"Inarisco Sanchez y Serna, a witness produced on the part of the libellant in this cause, on his solemn oath on the holy Evangelists of Almighty God, saith: That he, this deponent, received the 200 dollars mentioned in the libel (he being then captain of the said brigantine at the Havannah) of Cupisono, by the hands of the libellant; which money, or any part thereof, he, the deponent, hath not paid to Cupisono again; and that he employed the said money in paying wages to the crew, and in furnishing fresh provisions, until he should receive money from the intendant. That a survey was ordered upon the vessel, and a report made to the intendant, and he then received a verbal order to take his vessel from the bay to the upper part of the harbour. _ where the king's warehouses are. there to discharge, and after that to Transport his vessel to the king's arsenal, where she was repaired and had a new bottom. That he, the deponent, had no money, nor any person to whom he could apply to obtain the same. That the vessel leaked before he went into the Havannah to such a degree, as to make more than thirty inches of water in an hour. That he never knew Mr. Cupisono: but he had had three or four days\u2019 acquaintance with the libel-lant. That he requested the libellant to borrow him some money, and he took him to Mr. Cupisono\u2019s, where the money was paid to him. That the paper marked \u2018A,\u2019 exhibited in this' cause and shown to him, is a contract made between the libellant and the deponent. That at the house of Cupisono. the said Cupisono insisted upon the vessel and freight being hypothecat-ed to him, otherwise he would not lend the money. That Cupisono knew that the vessel put in in distress \u2014 that every body knew it. and that he, the deponent, had told Cupisono of it.\n\u201cBeing erossexamined, he saith, that the sailing orders (marked \u2018B\u2019) are the sailing orders he received. That the paper (marked \u2018C\u2019) is the charter-party signed between him and the freighter. That the paper (marked \u2018D\u2019) is the account delivered- by the deponent, on his return, to his owners. Being asked how he came to apply to the intendant for money, he saith, that he presented a memorial to him for that purpose. Being asked whether he got any money in consequence of the memorial, he says, that he did not; but he was obliged to present five or six memorials. Being asked, how long after he arrived at the Havannah he presented a memorial, he answers, that he received the money from Cupisono the first Sunday after his arrival. Being asked on what day he arrived at the Havannah. he answers, that he does not remember whether it was on Thursday or Wednesday; that the memorial was presented to tht intendant alter the money was received from Cupisono. That in the conversation he had with Cupisono, he told him that he expected to receive money from the intendant, as he was chartered on account of the king. That he took on board a passenger at St. Martha, who was to proceed with him to this country. Being asked, whether, being at Jamaica, he did not dispose of an adventure of his own, lie answered, lie did, but they were not goods of the king's; that he invested the proceeds in dry goods, which he intended to dispose of at the Havan-nah. That he told Cupisono that he had contraband goods on board which he had brought from Jamaica. That in the course of conversations with Cupisono (for he had several) he does not recollect particulars. That Cupisono did not ask him the nature of his voyage. That Cupi-sono knew that the vessel was freighted with dye-wood on account of the king, and wasdesigned for some port in the United States. That he had informed Cupisono that he had received money from the intendant; but that a little while before he sailed he met Cupisono. who asked him how he was off for money? to which the deponent replied, that he should be much straitened, whereupon the agreement (marked \u2018E,\u2019 exhibited in this cause) was made and executed between them. That he was near two months and an half at the Havannah. Being asked, whether the paper (marked \u2018E\u2019) was given on the day it bears date, he answers, that it was not given on the day it bears date, nor does he recollect whether it was the day after, or three or four days after, but that the money was bona fide paid by Cupisono and received by the deponent, and that he does not recollect when the paper (marked \u2018E\u2019 the hypothecation bond) was executed.\u201d\n6 Translation of the .Sailing Orders.\n\u201cPhiladelphia, 18th of October, 1787.

That the said Na-risco Sanchez y Serna, being on the high seas and within the jurisdiction of this court, viz. at the Havannah, in the island of Cuba, was under the necessity of taking up money on the freight and property of the said brigantine, the said brigantine having suffered by storms and tempests on the high seas, and the crew of the said brigantine being in want of provisions. In consequence whereof, and from the prolongation of the voyage thereby occasioned, the said Narisco Sanchez, y Serna did then and there, upon the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court, borrow from Santiago Cupisono the sum of 200 Mexican' dollars, equal to the sum of \u00a375 lawful money of Pennsylvania; in consideration whereof, the said Narisco Sanchez, y Serna did, on the 6th day of June, 1788, on the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court, by a certain writing, with the proper hand of the said Narisco Sanchez y Serna, then captain, thereto subscribed, (which said writing is here exhibited to this-court) contract, covenant and agree with the said Santiago Cupisono, and to him did hy-pothecate the said brigantine, and her freight,, in the words following, viz.

That Alexander Baudin the captain, had totally altered this voyage by repeated deviations, whereby the contract was broken, and thereupon the libellant prays a discharge and the amount of wages due. The circumstances .of this case appear from the testimony exhibited, to be as follows: That this vessel sailed from Nantz the twenty-third of October, 1786; that the mariners understood and were informed that this voyage was to be to New Orleans first, thence to the West Indies and thence back to Nantz or to some port of France, and that it would continue from 10 to 15 or 16 months, and under this expectation the mariners were registered at the proper office at Nantz, according to the manner of registering seamen in France. That instead of pursuing this voyage, as designated to them, they were taken three times to New Orleans, twice to Martinico, thence to Aux Cayes, once to the Havannah and were now brought to Philadelphia. That in the course of these several voyages, the libellant and others of the crew made frequent complaints of the deviation from and prolongation of the originally intended voyage, and had applied to the intendants of some of the ports they were at, demanding to be discharged, or taken back to France, but were detained in the service of the ship by repeated assurances of the captain, that from the then nest intended port they should be taken back to France. That in particular, when they were at Martinico the second time, the whole crew complained and demanded their discharge, whereupon the captain threw the boatswain and another sailor into prison, and that the boatswain wrote to the commanding officer of a frigate there, who sent for him on board, obliged the captain to pay him his wages and discharged him.\nTo this libel and testimony, the respondent hath urged in reply: That no contract or arti- . cles between the captain and crew at Nantz hath been exhibited or proved; that the libel itself is deficient in form, and that, let the deviations from the original voyage be what they may, the libellant hath for his part justified the whole by signing a process verbal on board the ship on the 30th of April last, certifying that the ship L\u2019Heureux had suffered damage by storm, and consenting to put into the port of Philadelphia in distress, which verbal process, so signed, was exhibited in court. As there is no ordinance of the United States, or act of the legislature of Pennsylvania touching the present point, the claim of the libellant, who is a French subject, and was shipped in France, will most properly be determined by the marine ordinances of the country to which he belongs, and under which he engaged in the service of this vessel. These ordinances strictly prohibit any captain or master of a vessel from receiving on board his ship any mariner, as such, who is not entered on his role d\u2019equipage, made up in the commissary\u2019s office, or bureau de classes, of the port where the vessel shall be. See Ord. de Marine, vol. 1, pp. 422, 715. Now, as it has not been controverted but that the libellant has served on board this ship ever since she sailed from Nantz, it is in vain to call upon him for proof of the contract made at Nantz, since the role d\u2019equipage, or a transcript of it, is in the captain\u2019s hands, and never in the mariner\u2019s. Had no such engagement taken place as mentioned in the libel, or should the libellant demand larger, wages than had been agreed upon, the captain would have shewn the role d\u2019equipage in propf against him. As he has not done this, although in his power, it follows that the allegation of the libellant must be admitted as true. Indeed it is in positive testimony that the libellant entered on board at Nantz, and was to receive 50 livres per month, wages; which is sufficient proof of a contract.\nThe next point is to consider the repeated deviations from the original voyage, and how far this should operate in releasing the mariner from his contract. To lay it down as a general rule that the least deviation from a designated voyage, should invalidate the articles and discharge the mariners in a foreign port, \u2022 would perhaps be construing shipping articles too strictly, and certainly very injurious to commerce. Shipping articles are not to be construed by the same rules with a policy of insurance, their object and ground of reason being quite different. Yet gross and unnecessary deviation shall free a mariner from his contract; but there is no occasion to fix a general rule now \u2014 this cause is to be determined by the positive laws of France, and there is an ordinance express to the purpose. Ord. de Marine, vol. 1, p. 548, art. 4. See 2 Pet. Adm. Append, p. 14. \u201cIf at any time after the arrival and discharge of the vessel at the port of her destination, the captain or master, instead of returning, shall freight or load his ship to go elsewhere, the mariner may leave her if he ehuses, unless it has been otherwise determined by. his special engagement.\u201d And this rule is further enforced by Valin\u2019s commentary on the article. There appears to me a strong presumption that the boatswain who was paid off and discharged at Martinico by order of the commander of a frigate there, claimed the benefit of this ordinance. It is said, indeed, that his mother was dead, and he had business in France: but this, I think, would hardly be admitted as a sufficient reason to discharge a mariner in the midst of a voyage. Such as it was, it is plain that Captain Baudin did not deem it sufficient,. for he put the man in prison for demanding his wages and claiming his discharge.\nThe objections to the libel in point of form are not sufficient to exclude this cause from the notice of the court It is indeed, not so precise as might be wished, but the substance of the complaint is alleged, viz. an engagement for a certain voyage, frequent deviations from the voyage proposed, and a citation prayed for, to shew cause why the wages accrued should not be paid, and the libellant discharged. The verbal process signed by the libellant on board the ship is the next circumstance relied on by the respondent; but this, I think, cannot have the operation expected. If the ship was really in distress as declared, there is no doubt but any mariner would sign his consent to put into a strange port, to avoid impending danger and refit the damaged rigging. But this deviation, occasioned, as it should seem, by necessity, cannot be deemed a justification of former deviations, where no such necessity appears, or is even pretended.\nI am clearly of opinion, that if this cause was tried before a French court of justice, the libellant could not be refused the benefit of the marine ordinances of France, so expressly in favour of his claim. Therefore, I adjudge and decree, that Charles Moran have and receive from the respondent in this cause, his wages at the rate of 50 livres per month, from the 23d of October, 178G, to the date of the present libel, and that the respondent pay the costs of suit.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The CYRUS."], "judges": ["Before PETERS, District Judge."], "opinions": [{"text": "As there are no depositions filed in this cause, but the suit has, by consent of counsel on both sides been conducted on oral testimony. X may not perhaps be able to state the case \u2022with that precision I might otherwise have done. I have, however.- given close attention to the witnesses and find the leading circumstances to be follows. The libellants entered on board the ship Cyrus. Thomas Scott, master, in the month of April last, and signed articles in the usual form for a voyage from Pliiladelphia to the port of Lisbon and back again. YYlien the ship had got under way, the mariners discovered that she was'very badly provided with running rigging; that many of the halliards and ropes were not in the usual condition of a vessel entering upon a voyage: that they could not clue the sails without going aloft to search for the proper ropes; and that, upon enquiry, they found there was but one coil or spare running rigging on board to remedy these defects. Whereupon, when the ship had come to, a few miles down the river, they remonstrated to the captain, and finally refused to weigh anchor, or proceed -with the vessel in her present condition. How this remonstrance and refusal was conducted, whether in a mutinous disorderly manner or otherwise, does not appear by any part of the testimony. Upon this the captain dispatched a messenger to the city to inform the owners of his situation, and in consequence of this intelligence, Captain Keith, one of the owners, went down to the ship, and took with him several hired men, either to assist in getting the vessel under way. or to compel the mariners to do their duty. What passed between Captain Ivoith and the discontented seamen does not appear, except that, before he left the ship, he prevailed with them to proceed on the voyage, promising that if they would do their duty, and behave themselves well for the remainder of the time, no notice should hereafter be taken of their late conduct, nor any deduction made from their wages on that account. Captain Scott standing by and hearing these assurances given them. This affair occasioned a delay of the ship of two or two and a half days. The vessel then prosecuted her voyage, during which the mariners supplied the deficiency of running rigging by untwisting old ropes and manufacturing them over again into ropes fit for the purposes wanted. In due time the ship completed her voyage, and returned safe to Fliiladelphia. On the third of September the ship was moored in the port, and at eleven o'clock in the evening of the same day. the mariners in general, if not all of them, left the vessel and went on shore. The captain being present, desired them to return early next morning to go to their work: and they came back accordingly, some at and some before day-light; but no orders were given as to what they were to do. except to two of them, who were directed to unbend certain sails, which they did. The mariners observing that men were hired by the day to unload the cargo, and seeing no preparations made for their provision, or that the kettle was cold, (as they term it,) enquired of the cook, whether he had received any orders to provide for the crew, who told them he had not received any; and they knowing that there was no meat on board, the last of their store having been consumed the day before, again left the ship, and went on shore. It appears that some of the libellants, and particularly John Winters,\n2\nwent frequently afterwards to visit the ship, and sometimes staid two hours on board, without receiving any orders from the captain to go to work; and that the captain saw them come and go without desiring their attendance, or reproaching them for their absence, until at length they looked upon themselves as discharged from the ship\u2019s service.\nUpon these facts the counsel for the respondents hath urged against the libellants that they have in two instances violated their contract, and forfeited their wages. First, in a mutinous refusal to do their duty on board, on a frivolous pretence of deficiency in the vessel\u2019s rigging; and secondly, In leaving the ship as soon as she arrived in port, and before her cargo was discharged. That it is manifest their complaint of the rigging was frivolous, because the ship hath completed her voyage without any addition of naval stores, observing that it would be very injurious to commerce if mariners should, on slight causes and artificial complaints, be encouraged to justify a disobedience of orders, as they are, for the most part, not in a situation to answer the damage they may occasion to owners by the delays and losses which such disobedience may incur. That the promise of the owner, in the present case, that no deduction should be made from the wages of the libellants on account of their refusal to do duty, cannot avail, or in the least affect the strict operation of the articles, because the mariners do not contract with the owner, but with the captain; and that it is for this reason only, they are allowed to sue in the admiralty, and have a lien upon the ship. Molloy, 236, 244, 250; 1 Salk. 33. So that the owner, being no party to the articles, cannot by his engagoment alter the terms thereof, or qualify their construction. That although Captain Scott was present and heard the assurances given by the owner to the libellants, yet, as he did not himself expressly join in those assurances, the penalty on a breach of the articles remains in full force against the mariners; and that these articles, like other contracts. ought to be strictly construed. And lastly, that their deserting the ship before the cargo was discharged, without the express permission of the captain, is of itself a forfeiture of wages by the- plain and direct terms of the articles.\nIn attending to these facts and arguments, I find it necessary to observe that shipping articles, as they are usually drawn, fully express the duties and obligations on the part of the mariners, and the penalties they are liable to for non-performance, but on the part of the captain there is no stipulation mentioned, except the payment of monthly wages, which is made the sole consideration. But notwithstanding this silence of the articles, law and reason will imply sundry engagements of the captain to the mariners. Two of which are: First, that at the commencement of a voyage, the ship shall be furnished with all the necessary and customary requisites for navigation, or, as the term is, shall be found seaworthy; and, secondly, that the captain shall supply the mariners with good and sufficient provisions whilst they are in his service. I am far from wishing to intimate, that it is either necessary or proper that the merchant or captain should be obliged to exhibit to the mariners he engages, a list of his stores, to take their opinion whether they are sufficient or not; yet when from accidental neglect or otherwise, there is a manifest and visible deficiency, the mariners may reasonably complain and remonstrate\u2014as in the present case, when the seamen were obliged to go to the main top to command those ropes which are usually within reach from the deck, and there could not be found on board a sufficiency of spare rigging to supply the defect. I think such a vessel cannot be said to be duly furnished for a voyage, according to the implied contract of the captain. I say such a complaint may reasonably be made at the commencement of the voyage, whilst it is yet in the power of the captain to procure all necessaries; for when the ship is at sea, nothing but inability can excuse the mariner for a refusal of duty, whatever deficiencies may then occur, or be discovered. With respect to the objection made to the validity of the owner\u2019s promise, I would observe, that although the contract of the mariner is always with the captain by name, yet it is the owner who actually pays the wages; and it happens not unfrequently, that the owner engages the mariners before it is known, who the captain for the voyage will be. But the law makes no distinction; the mariner may sue either the ship, the captain, or the owner for wages duly earned, and a summary jurisdiction is allowed to him. But, to give full force to the argument, and suppose, that because the articles are made in the name of the captain, he alone could make the promise alluded to with effect, yet as Captain Scott stood by and heard the owner give these assurances to the libellants, and did not declare his dissent, it amounts to such a tacit acquiescence as ought in equity to be construed a confirmation of the engagement on his part. For it ought not to be supposed, that Captain Scott stood silent by, with a reserved- determination that after the mariners should have performed the services of the voyage, he would cut them off from their wages, by disputing the authority of the owner to pardon a breach of the articles. To close this part of the subject.\u2014Supposing the libellants to have been ever so reprehensible, and liable in damages for the delay they had occasioned, yet they could not by the terms of the articles, forfeit more wages than what were due at the time of committing the of-fence: for how can wages be forfeited which have not yet accrued?\nI now come to the second charge laid against the libellants, viz. their leaving the ship at the conclusion of <the voyage before the cargo was discharged, contrary to an express article in the contract. And here there can be no doubt but that the general maritime law, and the tenor of most, if not all shipping articles, requires that the mariner shall stay by the ship until her cargo is safely landed, under the penalty of forfeiting all the fruits of his preceding labour, if he wilfully and disobediently abandons his duty in this particular. But if the owner or captain, as is frequently the case, shall find it more for his interest to hire men on daily pay to unload the ship, than to keep the crew under monthly wages, and find them with provisions in port he may certainly release the mariner from this part of his duty. This appears to me to have been the intention in the present case. No provisions were on board, nor any ordered for the use of the crew. The mariners, or some of them, repeatedly left and returned to the ship in the presence of the captain, without his expressing the least dissatisfaction at their conduct, or giving them any orders of duty. Men were hired by the day to discharge the cargo, without any intimation given to the libel-lants that this was done in consequence of them absence. And finally, some of the crew have been fully paid off, although under the same circumstances of conduct with the libel-lants. These strong marks of consent on the part of the captain, and more especially the total want of provisions on board, are sufficient, I think, to screen the libellants from being considered as deserters, so as to forfeit their wages. See the case of Swift v. The Happy Return [Case No. 13,697]. I adjudge and decree, that the libellants have and receive their wages to the third of September, instant; and that the respondents pay the costs of this suit.\n2 John AYinters. one of the libellants, was alone able to give the usual security on instituting the suit: but it was agreed by counsel, that the issue of the cause with respect to him. should be conclusive as to the rest.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

On account of the great charge entrusted to the master, and for the benefit of commerce, the law holds his office in high estimation, and vests him with a great extent of discretionary power. It gives him absolute command over the seamen in all matters concerning their duty and the object of their service, but not an absolute command over their persons. The master has a right to correct a refractory, disobedient mariner; but wherever this right is recognized in the books, moderate chastisement is always exprest or intended. For the law always watches the exercise of discretionary power with a jealous eye. The relation between a master and his servant or apprentice is such, that of necessity a discretionary authority is allowed by law to the master, yet nothing is more frequent than the intervention of the civil power to dissolve this connection, when the master is found to abuse his authority by undue severity and cruelty. Under such circumstances. the servant is justified in leaving his master. Keeping a servant from meat and drink, or battery, are good causes for a departure from the service. Fitzh. Nat. Brev. 391; 1 Bl. Comm. 428. The shipping articles, indeed, declare that forty-eight hours absence from the vessel, during the voyage, without leave, shall be deemed a total desertion, and incur a forfeiture of wages. But I would observe here, as I did lately upon another occasion, that although the sole contract men-lioned in these articles on the part of the master or owner, is the payment of wages, yet law and reason will imply other obligations\u2014 such as, that the vessel shall be sea-worthy and properly fitted for navigation \u2014 that the mariners shall be supplied with sufficient meat and drink, and that they shall be treated with, at least, decent humanity.\nFi'om a general review of the testimony, and indeed from the mate\u2019s own account, it is manifest that the libellants have been cruelly beaten and abused on board this brig at sundry times, and especially in the port of Lisbon, where the captain found it necessary to take one of them on shore and put him under the care of a surgeon to be cured of the wounds and bruises he had suffered under the chastisement given him by the captain and his mate. The only justifications alleged for this great severity, are a general charge against the mariners of disobedience and insufficiency in their duty, without specifying any particulars, and an appearance of a mutinous combination between them in the port of Lisbon. I have carefully considered the testimony with regard to this last suggestion, but cannot find sufficient grounds to support the charge. The words \u201cwe shall see who will be master of this brig,\u201d seem to have a natural reference to the request the mariners had just before made to him to be master of his own vessel, and not to suffer the male to tyrannize over them in the manner he had done. As to the assertion that Hughes attempted to strike the mate, and that Lamant actually did strike him, it is not supported by testimony sufficient to establish a charge so highly criminal. But what I principally look to, is the general conduct of the mariners on this occasion. Finding themselves so cruelly treated by the mate, they first made their complaint to the captain; instead of obtaining the redress they expected, the captain joined the mate in punishing them still more severely for making this complaint. This extreme severity, together with the declaration of the mate, that he would make them glad to jump overboard before they got to America, seems to have taken away all hope of redress or even safety on board, and the whole crew left the vessel. When on shore, they did not secrete themselves, but frequently sought for and met the captain, and openly demanded their wages and clothes; and finally, they applied to the legal authority at Lisbon, and obtained a process against the captain. This conduct on the part of the mariners, seems to remove every appearance of an intended mutiny or a voluntary desertion. If the suspicion of either had been well founded, why did not the captain apply to the courts of law at Lisbon, to have them secured and tried for their offences. This he did not do, but on the contrary, promised to pay them their \u2022wages, and anxiously avoided the process they had taken out against him.\nIt is not necessary to enquire what effect the captain\u2019s promise to pay the mariners their wages, after they had left the vessel might have, as a legal assumption, after the' supposed forfeiture, because I find very sufficient grounds for determining the cause w\u2019ith-out it. The libellants have not voluntarily deserted, but have been forced from a service in which neither the rights of humanity nor personal safety could be depended upon or even expected.\nI adjudge that the libellants have and receive their wages to the time of their leaving the vessel at Lisbon (for this is all the libel-lants ask for),\n2\nand that the respondent pay the costs of suit.\n2 The claims of seamen to wages, under circumstances similar to those mentioned in this case, for the whole voyage, have been frequently allowed in the district court by Judge Peters, and there are many cases in the English books, in which the principles on which such claims are founded, have been recognized.", "author": "THE COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

Weeks] claiming a reasonable salvage for goods preserved from a wreck at sea, and the other [by Jurgen Jurgenson] suing for mariners\u2019 wages; the voyage having been finished by the sinking of the vessel. The circumstances of the case appear to be as follows: The scow Catharina Maria, Peter Moller, captain,, being on her return voyage from St Croix, to Copenhagen, was on the twenty-first of September last, overtaken with heavy storms, in which she suffered so long and so much, that on the eighth of October, she became a mere wreck, and no hope of safety was left. In this extremity Captain Benjamin Weeks, belonging to and bound for Philadelphia, came up with the distressed ship, and received the Catharina\u2019s crew on board his vessel. The wind, however, soon after moderated, so that Captain Weeks was enabled by the assistance of his own crew to take from the wreck 6 pipes and an ullage of Madeira wine, 6 cases of the like wine, 12 bales of cotton, and sundry articles of rigging, after which the Catharina Maria sunk and was lost.\nThe first object is, to ascertain what reasonable salvage should be allowed to Captain Weeks on the goods and materials thus saved and brought into port; and secondly, what wages the mariners of the lost vessel are entitled to, on this unfortunate conclusion of their voyage. As to the first, salvage is an allowance made by the consent of all nations and all laws, for saving a ship or goods from the danger of the seas, from fire, pirates or enemies. Lex Rhod. 46; Lex Mercat. 146; Park, Ins. 147; Wesk. Ins. 488; and other authors on the subject. The quantum, however, of this allowance cannot, from its own nature, be fixed by any maritime rule or statute; because the reason of the law must be governed by the circumstances of the case, which will be various, according to the hazard, trouble and expense of the salvage. \u201cIf only the ship perishes, and the goods are saved, in that case, the goods ought to pay a proportion of a fifth or tenth penny, according to the easy or difficult winning or saving of the said goods.\u201d Moll. de J. Mar. bk. 2, c. 5, \u00a7 4; Lex Oler. c. 4. So that the hazard or trouble should be the rule of salvage. In regulating the discretion of the courts in such cases, oppressive salvage, such as may accumulate distress on the unfortunate, should be avoided on the one part, and on the other a generous allowance should be the reward of those who exert themselves in the cause of humanity.\nBy these principles I have considered the circumstances of the present case, and finding by the testimony, that the salvage has not been attended with any extraordinary hazard or difficulty, I adjudge to Captain Benjamin Weeks, one-third part of the goods and materials saved from the wreck of the Catharina Maria, free of all legal costs or charges whatever. As to the mariners\u2019 wages, it is a general rule of law, that if the ship perishes the mariner loses his wages: because, if they are allowed their wages, their best endeavours may be wanting to preserve the ship. But this seems to be rather a rule of policy than of natural justice; and is generally restricted to cases of a total loss, and before any port of delivery hath been attained. For If any of the goods have been saved and delivered in a place of safety, the mariners do not lose their wages for the whole voyage. 1 Ld. Raym. 739; Keble, 831; Park, 592. However doubtful the law may be, with respect to the mariners\u2019 wages in cases of a total loss of ship and cargo, there can be none, when a considerable part of the goods have been brought into port, and delivered up to a competent authority to take charge of them. So long as the duty of the mariners calls for their attentions and services in the preservation of the ship or cargo, or of any part thereof, so long does their lien for wages inure, in proportion at least to the value of the property so saved. I adjudge, that the libellants have and receive their wages according to the ship\u2019s articles to the twenty-eighth day of\u2019 October last, at which time, the remains of the wrecked cargo and rigging were delivered into the custody of the marshal of this court.", "author": "BY THE COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

That after their arrival at Philadelphia, the captain, without any new agreement whatever, undertook another voyage to St. Andero in Spain and back again to the port of Philadelphia, with the libellants on board, where the vessel now is. It also appears that Captain Holmstedt had treated the libellants with uncommon severity and cruelty, especially Weiberg, whom he had confined in jail six days in Philadelphia, before their sailing for St. Andero, and as soon as he was taken on board again, beat him and otherw-ise abused him, so that he lay three days disabled from doing any duty. That after their return to this port the last time, the libellants made application to a proctor of this court, to sue for the justice of the country in their behalf. That in prosecuting this business, they had been absent from the brig about three hours, and on their return to the vessel, the captain caused them both to be pinioned and confined; threatening them with a drawn cutlass and denouncing vengeance against them. And that afterwards, whilst this cause was before the court and during an adjournment thereof, the captain caused Weiberg, one of the libellants, to be laden with irons and chains, and confined on board the brig.\nUnder these circumstances. I am of opinion, first, that the deviation to the port of St. Andero in Spain, was such an alteration of the voyage, as might justify the mariner in demanding his wages. And secondly, that Captain Holmstedt's conduct with regard to the libellants, hath been so cruel and unwarrantable by the maritime law;, as would of itself have dissolved the contract \u2014 the rights of humanity being superior to the specific laws and customs of any nation:\nWhereupon. I adjudge and decree, that Er-rick Weiberg and Nicholas Casterius be discharged from any further services on board the brig St. Oloff; and that they have and receive the sum of eighty-six dollars and twenty cents, in full of the wages respectively due to them. That is to say. to Errick Weiberg the sum of fifty-three dollars and eighty-six and two-thirds cents, and to Nicholas Casterius the sum of thirty-tw'o dollars and thirty-three and a third cents. And I do further decree, that the brig St. Oloff. with her tackle, apparel and furniture, or such parts thereof as may be necessary to satisfy this judgment, to-gethcr with the charges and costs of suit, be sold by tbe marshal of this district, according to law and custom, for the purposes aforesaid.\nIn the case of Willendson v.

Pennsylvania.\n[2 Pet. Adm. 428.]\n1\nWEIBERG et al. v. The ST. OLOFF.\nNov. 30, 1790.\nOn the nineteenth of November, 1790, a libel was filed in this court by Mr. Banltson. one of the proctors of the court, in behalf of Er-riek Weiberg and Nicholas Casterius, two mariners belonging to the brig St. Oloff. a Swedish vessel under the command of Jonas Holm-stedt. The complaint states, that the libel-lants had entered on board this vessel about the twenty-seventh day of December in the year 1789, at Cadiz, in the kingdom of Spain, on a voyage from thence to Philadelphia and back again to Cadiz; for the wages of five Spanish milled dollars per month. That the captain had. during the voyage, and since her arrival in this port, treated the libellants with uncommon cruelty, insomuch that it was dangerous for them to remain any longer in his employ: that application had been made in their behalf to Mr. Hellsteadt, the Swedish consul, resident in Philadelphia, who refused to grant them any redress. Whereupon, they pray that their wages may be paid, and themselves be discharged from any further continuance on board the said brig. In consequence of this libel, a citation was issued calling upon Jonas Holmstedt and all persons concerned, to appear and make their objections, if any they have, why a decree should not pass according to the prayer of the libel-lants. On the morning of the twentieth, the court met according to adjournment, when the marshal made return of the citation, certifying that the same had been duly served. The marshal\u2019s deputy at the same time informed the court, that he had first waited on Mr. Hell-steadt, the Swedish consul resident here, and informed him that he was going to serve the citation upon Captain Holmstedt. and shewed the copy of the writ; after which he went on board and presented it to the captain, who, absolutely refused to receive it. saying, in an angry manner, that he was on Swedish ground; that he then left the citation on the binnacle, and came away.\nSoon after this Mr. Hellsteadt the consul came into court, and after making some apology for the captain\u2019s behaviour, on account of his not understanding the English language, said, that by the laws of Sweden, the captain is vested with supreme command over his crew, who has a right to punish them according to his own discretion, to any extent, short of murder,- or breaking of limbs; and that he neither is. nor can be, answerable to any foreign jurisdiction whatever for the exercise of this power; being accountable to the Swedish courts of judicature alone, on the return of the ship; that it was the captain\u2019s duty to refuse obedience to the citation issued from this court, or to do any thing that should seem to acknowledge its jurisdiction in a question between him and any of his crew; and that by the treaty between the United States and the court of Sweden, it is stipulated that the subjects of Sweden shall enjoy the same privileges in the ports of the United States that have been or may be granted to the most favoured nation in amity with them. Inferring, that as by the convention with France, the French consuls in the ports of the United States have an exclusive jurisdiction in the adjustment of disputes between the captains and their mariners, so ought the regulations and discipline on board of Swedish vessels, to be governed by the Swedish laws and customs, without the interference of the courts of the United States.\nThe judge said, that he thought that the citation should have been attended to with more respect. However, he would take the objection to the jurisdiction of the court under advisement, and examine the treaties referred to.\nErrick Weiberg one of the libellants, then applied to the judge, suggesting that he was apprehensive of ill-usage if he should remain in the power of the captain. But the judge directed him to continue his duty on board; telling him, that he was under the protection of the court, and believed there was no danger of the captain\u2019s using him ill.\nAs yet no process had issued, except the citation; but as the jurisdiction of the court had been thus expressly denied, the proctor for the libellants moved on the twenty-second to amend his libel, and prayed that process might be awarded and issued against the brig St. Oloff, her tackle, &c. to abide the decree of this court in the cause aforesaid, which was ordered; an amended libel brought forward, and filed, and a writ of attachment issued accordingly.\nOn the twenty-third, the court being met, the proctor for the libellants complained that, notwithstanding what had been said on Saturday, the captain had seized upon Errick Weiberg, as soon as he came on board from attending on the court, had him put in heavy irons and confined him in the hold of the ves'sel. Weiberg was then examined, and testified to the cruel treatment he had received, and the irons and chains were brought in and laid before the judge.\nOn the twenty-fourth the Kev. Mr. Collin, the Swedish missionary resident in Philadelphia, appeared in court, and presented a letter signed by Jonas Holmstedt, in which he says, that \u201calthough he could not acknowledge the jurisdiction of the court in the cause brought before it by his seamen, as this would be repugnant to the allegiance he owed to the king of Sweden, yet no affront was intended to the court.\u201d At the same time another letter was handed to the judge, signed \u201cCharles Hell-steadt, Swedish Consul,\u201d in which he says, that he is responsible in a public line to the king of Sweden; that he had already remonstrated before the court for interfering in the dispute between Captain Holmstedt and two of his seamen. And that he by this letter, protested against any decision that should be made for or against the parties, as the complaint ought to have been made to him. as consul, agreeably to the treaty now in force, between Sweden and North. America.\nThe judge considered the cruel imprisonment of the libellant, whilst suing for justice, and under the protection of the law, as a manifest contempt of the court. He ordered all proceedings respecting the libel to be laid aside, until this contempt should be examined into, and the rights of humanity vindicated, which he said were paramount to all treaties.\nThe court was thereupon adjourned for an hour to meet at the state house, the court having hitherto sat at the admiralty office. The attorney of the United States for the district' of Pennsylvania, was called upon for his opinion, who attended, together with several gentlemen of the bar, and also some Swedish gentlemen, and others who had heard of the matter. After examining the testimony with respect to Captain Holmstedt\u2019s conduct, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Bankson, and Mr. Sergeant, united in opinion, that the treaty with Swedeh, as to the point in question, could not be so explained as to give the captain the exclusive jurisdiction he claims. That the words \"the most favoured nation.\u201d used in the treaty with Sweden, are the words used in all the treaties between the United States and foreign nations in amity with them, and were never interpreted to found a jurisdiction exclusive of, or inconsistent with, the laws of the United States in our own ports. That such a right was never pretended in constructions of the general treaty with Prance; but that for vesting such a'jurisdiction, a special convention \u25a0was thought necessary, the terms of which have been specifically designated, and not left to inferences, or general construction. That as the captain\u2019s conduct, in the instance before the court, could not be supported by his exposition of the \u00a1treaty, neither could he be justified in refusing obedience to the process of the court. And that this, together with the cruel treatment of the libellant, whilst under the protection of the court, was, and ought to be, deemed a contempt. Adding, however, that some allowance might reasonably be made, in alleviation, for the captain\u2019s being unacquainted with the language, and ignorant of the laws and customs of our country.\nThe judge having attended ro these arguments, observed, that the admitting a jurisdiction exclusive of the laws of the United States, was a matter of too serious import to be rested on implication alone. That the words referred to in the treaty with'Sweden could not by any construction be supposed to embrace all the objects comprehended in the special convention made with Prance. That let the question of jurisdiction be what it may, there could be no necessity for the contempt, which Captain Holmstedt had thrown upon the court, or of the violence with which the mariner had been treated. That a citation was the most moderate and unexceptionable process known, for bringing a matter before the court; after which, any plea to the jurisdiction might have been discussed, and would have been considered; but that his unprecedented conduct violated not only the rules of law, but even of common decorum. That he could not consistently with his duty, but consider the absolute refusal of answering to the citation, and the subsequent treatment of the libel-lant, whilst under the protection of the court, as a contempt, which ought not to pass unnoticed. That as to the amount of any fine that might be laid on this occasion, he was willing to give the apology that had been made its full weight, but that he was firm in asserting the rights and authority of this court in the matter now before it.\nJudgment. \u201cThat Jonas Holmstedt has been guilty of a contempt, in refusing to obey the process of the court, and in confining in irons a suitor whilst under the protection of the laws, and applying for the justice of the country. For which offence I award that he pay a fine of twenty dollars, with the costs of prosecution, and stand committed until this sentence is complied with.\u201d\nOn the twenty-fifth, the court met on the business of the libel. Mr. Collin, the Swedish minister, presented a letter to the judge, signed \u201cJonas Holmstedt,\u201d in which he says, that he is willing to answer any questions respecting the prosecution of this libel that may be asked, but cannot enter into any defence of his cause, as this would be a violation of the laws of Sweden, which he is, on his allegiance bound to obey. And then quotes a passage from the Swedish maritime law, directing that \u201cif any disputes on the sea or on shore should arise between the captain and his crew, the parties are not permitted to sue for redress in a place subject to a foreign government,\u201d &c. &e. But these letters were not noticed, inasmuch as they uniformly expressed a denial of the jurisdiction of the court.\nMr. Soderstrom, the Swedish consul, resident in Boston, being here, addressed the court and said: \u2014 That he was very sorry he had not sooner heard of this disagreeable business, which he would have endeavoured to prevent by all the means in his power. That he could not justify the conduct of Captain Holmstedt with respect to contempt, but as judgment had already past, the error was irretrievable: as to the libel now depending, he prayed the judge to indulge him with a little time whilst he endeavoured to accommodate matters between the parties, by proposing that the libellants should be discharged from the brig St. Oloff, and put on board some other vessel bound for Sweden, and that the wages due to them should be paid over to him (Mr. Soderstrom), in trust for the mariners, until the dispute might be determined in Sweden by a court of that country. The judge approving of this proposal, the court adjourned till further notice.\nOn the twenty-seventh, Mr. Bankson received a letter from the Rev. Mr. Collin, informing that the proposed accommodation had proved unsuccessful, as consul Hellsteadt, \u201cafter the unlimited protest he had before made, could not permit the seamen to be received on board of any other vessel.\u201d\nThe cause then proceeded in course; the witnesses were examined, and the testimony reduced to writing.\nOn the twenty-ninth, a further progress was made in the' cause, and some points of form adjusted.\nCase No. 17,357.\nTreaty Stipulation's \u2014 Jurisdiction op Foreion Consuls \u2014 Disputes between Master and Crew \u2014 Contempt of Court.\n[1. The stipulation in the treaty with Sweden that its subjects shall enjoy the same privileges in the ports of the United States as are granted to the most favored nation does not give Swedish consuls the same exclusive jurisdiction to adjust disputes between the masters and sailors on Swedish vessels as is granted the French consuls, by special convention, as to French vessels.]\n[2. The master of a foreign vessel absolutely refused to answer a citation issued in a suit by a mariner for wages, and confined the suitor in irons on his return from court, subsequently \u25a0excusing himself by an allegation that the United States courts had no jurisdiction over disputes between the master and seamen of a Swedish vessel. Held, that the master was in contempt.]\n[3. Seamen were engaged in the port of Cadiz, & statement being then made to them that they were going to Philadelphia and back to Cadiz, where they would be paid off and discharged. Held, that the action of the master, upon their arrival at Philadelphia, in undertaking, without any new agreement, a voyage to St. Andero, in Spain, and back to Philadelphia, justified the sailors in demanding their wages.]\n[4. The seamen were treated by the master with uncommon cruelty, and one of them was confined in jail on land six days, and, when taken on board again, was so abused that he was \u25a0disabled for three days from doing duty. They then made application in court for relief, and were detained in doing so three hours away from the vessel, and on their return they were pinioned and confined, and threatened with a \u25a0drawn cutlass; and later, while the suit was pending in court, the master had one of libel-ants loaded with irons and confined. Held, that the conduct of the master was so cruel and unwarrantable as to dissolve the contract of employment.]\n[Cited in The Jerusalem, Case No. 7.293; Davis v. Leslie, Id. 3,039; Bueker v.

The distressed and hopeless condition of the Belle Creole, is described in her log-book, in the gieat points nearly according with the testimony. This log-hook confirms, in many important points, the testimony on the part of the libellants, contradicts, in some instances, and supplies in others, facts omitted by the witnesses for the claimants and respondents. I do not find that the Amiable was in any real, though, like all vessels loitering on a coast, she was exposed to possible, danger, and unnecessarily protracted risque.\nThere have been three points made in this cause: 1st. Dereliction, and a claim of the whole under words used by the captain, said to amount to an express abandonment; and, from the circumstances of tlie case, a dereliction liy implication. 2d. That the delay of the Amiable, while attending on. and giving assistance. to. and saving the goods out of. the Belle Creole, was a deviation which exposed to risque, out of the common course of the voyage, aud would have forfeited any insurance which might have been made on the vessel and cargo, or either of them. 3d. Tlie quantum of salvage, if the first point should be determined against the libellants.\nOn the first point I have translated an authority out of Burlemaqui, which contains what I believe to be an accurate account of the ideas of the best writers on the subject of dereliction, and occupancy, consequential upon it: \u201cOne may acquire, by the right of the first occupant, tilings which the proprietor has abandoned with a design never more to hold them as his own. Although one is not in possession of a thing, the right of recovery is not lost, unless it is renounced in a manner either express or implied. Hence the i...is-tice of those countries whicli confiscate the property of goods shipwrecked, thrown overboard to lighten the vessel, or stolen, in place of returning them to the owners.\u201d The cases of dereliction, in which the maxim of \u201cOceu-pantis fiunt derelicta\u201d is founded, generally run on the principle of a voluntary abandonment by the owner, with his free consent; and not on such a relinquishment as force, necessity, or danger, compel. The instances of wreck, or goods thrown overboard to lighten the vessel, may he given to elucidate this doctrine; and these are always recoverable, on payment or tender of salvage. It should seem that little prospect of recovery existed in the case of goods ejected, to lighten and save the ship; yet the right of recovery is not lost; but, on proof of property, they are recoverable, on payment, or tender of salvage, if either driven on shore, or taken flotsam or jetsam. If tlie evidence in this .cause, supported (and I think it does not) the captain's consent to give the goods to the libellants, I do hot consider it as binding on the owners; and, according to the authority from Burlemaqui, (and many others) it must he the owner who abandons. The captain is vested with certain powers, both express and implied, over the ship and goods, for certain purposes beneficial to the owner; such as the power of hypothe-cation \u2014 of compounding for part, to save the rest \u2014 detaining for freight \u2014 throwing over part to preserve the residue \u2014 but herein he has a qualified and not an absolute propriety. Ho may act. under the limited rights with which he is thus invested for the benefit of the owner. but cannot totally divest hint of all tie-right. and transfer it. without special authority, even for a valuable consideration. He is inhibited, by the marine laws, to sell (thoinrh he may pledge) the tackle, or furniture saved from shipwreck, though necessary for tlie sub-sistance or payment of himself and crew: nor, even in cases of the quantum of salvage, should promises made by the. master, in time of distress, be regarded: but the reward must be measured accoiding to circumstances. Much less to he valued are the expressions he makes use of, tending to shew a dereliction, or abandonment of tlie property. I cannot, therefore, be of opinion that, in this case, there is an express dereliction, in the legal interpretation of the word. As to the implied (1-relic-tion, there are no circumstances to prove it. but those which generally accompany such unfortunate cases. If these were to be taken as proofs of abandonment, on which tlie right of occupancy would attach, there would be an end to all enquiries relating to salvage, in instances o\u00ed ships or goods forsaken. But the law is otherwise; and the ship, though forsaken, through fear of enemies, or to save the lives of the people, is not legally derelict, or even wreck or lost. I shall therefore dismiss, as untenable, the first point made in this cause, with the supplemental libel on which it arises.\nAs to the second point, which respects the quantum of salvage, and tends to shew the risque incurred, by the assistance given to the master and crew of the Belle Creole, to wit, the deviation, I should, in a case which I was under the necessity of determining, consider it as such. 1 am persuaded that the \u25a0delay of the Amiable exposed her to uncommon danger: and. as it was not necessary, in the course of the voyage, for any purposes which insurers might have had in view, but was merely produced by the circumstances \u25a0stated in the libel, it would. I think, have availed, in case of loss, to repel a claim of insurance. And the principle is the same, as to all consequences necessary to be considered in this cause, whether the owner remained his \u25a0own insurer, or threw the risque on others, by a policy descriptive of the voyage. A deviation is not merely the unnecessary going \u25a0out of the track, or course usually taken, but it is also a departure from either the express -or implied terms of the contract. It needs not much reasoning or discussion to shew that \u25a0delays for saving of ships, goods or mariners, producing uncommon risque, cannot be legal excuses on the part of the insured on policies as they are generally made. Such delays being \u201cbreaches of the implied terms of the contract, by exposing to hazards not originally counted upon, foreseen, or in the contemplation of the parties. They are justified to the heart, though not (in this respect) to the law. on principles of humanity, commendable in themselves. expected from all, and particularly from those who are exposed to similar misfortunes. Ships with letters of marque may \u2022chase an enemy, but cruising after prizes incurs deviation. But. without entering into many particular references to cases or instances, it appears to me that all excuses for leaving the course, or delays must be front necessity; and not with a view to lucrative \u2022objects. Putting into port by stress of weather \u2014 to stop a leak \u2014 obtain provisions. Ac. \u2014 going out of the track to avoid an enemy \u2014for convoy or other purposes \u2014 for the safety of the ship or goods, being beneficial to the insurers, are justifiable. But it is different in the ease of cruizing for prizes, and cases of a similar nature, which might be mentioned: and none of them appear to me stronger than the one in question.\nOn the third point I have taken into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and the law respecting it. so far as I can perceive it applicable. With respect to goods and merchandize. I can find no decided rules as to the proportion of salvage; those of the maritime laws, which have made any designations of proportions, varying from each other, and giving from a twentieth to a half, according to the description and value of the articles saved, and the risk, labour, and expense of salvage. On plate, jewels and money, the salvage is the least: and on articles of other descriptions, according to circumstances. I find, however, that the former articles are not exempted, either from average, contributions, or salvage. The general principle is not confined to mere quantum me-ntir, as to the person saving; but is expanded, so as to comprehend a reward for the risk of life and property, labour and danger, in the undertaking, as well as a premium operating as an inducement to similar exertions. It is laid down as a principle both of justice and policy, that \u201che who has recovered the property of another from imminent danger, by great labour, or perhaps at the hazard of his life, should be rewarded by him who has been so materially benefitted by that labour.\u201d\nI consider, in the case in question, the property risked by the owners of the ship Amiable combined with the danger to which her officers and crew were exposed in the enterprise; and, though 1 do not depreciate the exertions of the officers and crew of La Belle Creole, yet all these exertions would have been useless, unnecessary, and impracticable, if the Amiable had not been present and exposed in the undertaking to risk, and her officers and crew to danger. The labour and difficulty, too, exercised and experienced by the latter, were considerable, and unremit-ted. The season of the year, and the place where the transaction happened, exposed the Amiable and her cargo to extraordinary hazard. With respect to the projwrtion of salvage, all circumstances taken into view, I have, in the general, been guided by what I consider just in the present case, as well as politic in all cases. Combining both these circumstances together. 1 cannot have a better guide, nor one which ought to be more satisfactory to one of the parties in this cause at least, than the 17th article of book 4, c. 19, of the Marine Ordinances of France, on the subject of wreck, which I have translated: \"If the effects, however wrecked, are found on the sea. or drawn from its bottom, the third part thereof shall be immediately delivered, without expense, either specifically or in money, to those who have saved them, and the two other thirds shall be kept to be delivered to the owners, if they shall claim them within the time above mentioned: after which they shall be equally divided between us and the admiral, the costs of prosecution being previously deducted from the two thirds.\u201d Although I do not exactly follow, yet 1 have as nearly accommodated my determination to. this ordinance, as I think right. I do therefore adjudge, order and decree. That the libel lants in this cause, to wit. the owner or owners of the ship Amiable, and the master, first and second mate, the carpenter, and crew (including boys and cook) of the said ship, have and receive, in full satisfaction, for and as salvage, the one third part of the gross amount of the sales of the goods, wares and merchandize, as mentioned in the account of sales rendered by the marshal of the district, free anti clear of all expenses, costs, duties and charges whatsoever; and also the one eighth part of the appraised value and amount of the plate and money mentioned in the inventory, Mo. 2, to be divided among the said owner, or owners, master, mates, carpenter and crew, in the following proportions, to wit:\nThree fourth parts thereof shall be received and taken by Jeremiah Warder or the owner or owners of the ship Amiable, for his and their sole and separate use and property. That the remaining fourth part of the said salvage (which, though less than is common in a case of prize in war, is, I think, with their wages, sufficient: as the danger of conflict did not exist, which as to prizes adds to the risk, and increases the reward) shall be divided to and among the officers and crew of the said ship, in manner following, to wit, The said fourth part shall be divided into twenty-six equal shares or parts, whereof\nShares\nThe captain shall and is hereby directed to receive . S\nThe chief mate. 4\nThe second mate. S\nThe carpenter. 2\nAnd each mariner and the cook one share S\nBach boy half a share. 1\nAmounting in the whole to. 20\nThat the plate and money shall be restored to Captain Davor, for the use of himself and those of the French officers and crew of La Belle Creole, to whom the articles therein contained respectively belong, on payment of the proportion of the appraised value thereof, herein before decreed for salvage. That the whole amount of the proceeds of the sales, of the goods and merchandize, as mentioned in the marshal's return, and account of sales, together with the salvage decreed on 1be plate and money, be brought into court: and, after paying thereout the one third of the amount of the former, and the salvage as aforesaid on the latter, the other two remaining thirds shall be subject to the following expenses and payments, which are hereby directed to be discharged and made forthwith.\nThe eosts accrued, and to accrue, in this cause, shall be fully paid and discharged, and all expenses incurred in the storage, and on the sale of the whole, as they shall be examined and taxed; and all duties and customs therein locally chargeable, and charged, shall also be paid thereout. After all the said eosts and charges and duties shall be fully paid and discharged, the balance of the said two thirds shall remain in this court, subject to the further order, judgment and decree thereof.\n1 [See note at end of case.]", "author": "PETERS, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The Cato. Case No. 13,780. Cited in Markham v. Simpson, 22 Fed. 745.]\nNOTE. The libel states that, on the 10th day of November. 1702, the Amiable being on a voyage from Charleston. South Carolina, for Philadelphia, a ship was discovered in distress; upon which the Amiable shortened sail, changed her course, and found said ship to be La Belle Creole, commanded by Davor, bound to Bordeaux. La Belle Creole was declared to be sinking, and the master of the Amiable requested to remain by her, which was done by making light sai) on board the Amiable. The distress of La Belle Creole continued; the weather was tempestuous, and on the 12th. after repeated solicitations from the master and crow of La Belie Creole, they were received on board the Amiable; and, before they left La Belle Creole, a proposition was made by them to burn her. On the master and crew of La Belle Creoie leaving their ship, they declared they relinquished and abandoned her, and every thing on board of her. La Belle Creole was left without a living person on board of her. On the following morning she was again boarded by the master and crew of the Amiable, and a large quantity of merchandise taken from her. On the evening of the same day, at the request of Captain Davor, she was set on fire. The-Amiable afterwards arrived in Philadelphia. The libel prays a reasonable salvage may be allowed.\nA supplementary libel was afterwards filed, in which the goods are claimed by the owners, master, and crew of the Amiable, as wholly belonging to them \"as goods derelict and abandoned,\u201d and their delivery to the owners, &e. is prayed.\nThe claim and answer of Captain Davor, master of La Belle Creole, state..that his ship was in great distress, and in danger of perishing; and that he, together with his crew, were taken on board the Amiable on the loth day of November. That on that day. and before and afterwards, the mate of the Amiable, and some mariners belonging to her. together with the crew of La Belle Creole, saved the goods and materials libelled and claimed. Captain Davor denies the abandonment of the ship and cargo, but declares an intention was entertained by him to repossess the same, should he at any time after be able so to do: and particularly denies the surrender of La Belie Creoie. &c. to the master and crew of the Amiable: and asserts. that the said master and crew of the Amiable, at the period aforesaid, declared that all they 'saved was for the master and crew of La Belle Creole. The claim and answer further state, that the master of La Belle Creole-could not abandon the goods. <X:c. as they did not belong to him. hut to persons in France: and that, even had they so abandoned them, the same being done under the impression of fear and danger, and from extreme necessity, could have no effect. It is also stated Hint, as the respondents were always in sight, or within reach of the property, and assisted in saving them, by the civil and maritime law they cannot be considered as derelict. The respondents say they are willing to allow the libellants \u2018*a reasonable salvage, proportionate to their trouble and exertions.\u201d Captain Davor states that the articles found in his trunks, not being merchandise, but money, furniture. Ac. belonging only to himself, and the mariners of La Belle Creole, are not by the maritime law and custom liable to salvage; he therefore prays, that tlie marshall lie ordered to return the same-to him, free of salvage and all charges. By the depositions of the witnesses produced on the part of Warder and others, the principal facts, as stated in The libel, are established; and it is further stated, that at the time the master and crew of-La Belle Creole were taken on board the Amiable, and before the greater part of the goods were saved, Captain Davor ordered the ship to be burned, and this was only prevented by the interference of the master of the Amiable. It is further stated, that after the master and crew of La Belle Creole were received on board the Amiable, they lost sight of the said vessel, and, supposing she had gone down, tho master of the Amiable determined to proceed to America. When the sun rose the next day La Belle Creole was discovered, boarded, and the greater part of the articles saved were taken on board the Amiable. She had. at this time, eleven feet of water in the hold, and the water was up to the cabin floor: on leaving her she was set on fire. It is also admitted in the depositions of these witnesses, that the crew of La Belle Creole assisted in saving the goods. &c. After the arrival of the Amiable in Philadelphia, an attempt was made, by the officers of La Belle Creole, to bribe the mate, and one of the seamen of the Amiable, to assist in smuggling some of the articles saved. In the depositions of the witnesses produced on the part of the respondents, some of the circumstances stated in the claim and answer are detailed; but no proof was offered in support of the assertion in the claim and answer, that Captain Davor entertained any expectation, or intention, that he would, at any time, regain possession of the ship, goods, &c. One half of the cargo of La Belle Creole had been thrown overboard before the Amiable was spoken; and, but for her assistance, all would have perished.\n1 [Reported by Richard Peters, Jr., Esq.]"}}}, {"id": 6131699, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/6131699/", "name": "WARDROP v.

There are some circumstances, however, clearly ascertained by those exhibits, which I shall have occasion to mention in the course of the observations I shall make on the merits hereafter. The libel complains of the illegal capture of the sloop George [Robert Smith, master], and her cargo, the property of .the libellant, then and now a subject of Holland, during the late war, to Wit, in July, 177S, by the schooner privateer Addition, Moses Griffin, commander, belonging to the testator Joseph Carson, and others, who are named in the answer of Joseph Carson, in his life time. It is alleged, on the part of the respondents, that the vessel captured was employed in carrying goods, belonging to the subjects of Great Britain, contrary to the regulations and laws of the then congress. They rely on the libel and condemnation in the state court of admiralty of New Jersey.. The verdict of the jury, ascertaining the facts, and the condemnation by the' court, and order of sale and for payment of nett proceeds to the captors. The sale of the vessel and cargo at vendue, and the monies being received by the marshal of the court, in whose hands, it is said, they now remain, in depreciated paper, not having been distributed to and among the captors, and of course the respondents, or their testator, received no part thereof; and therefore they allege that the marshal only is chargeable to the libellant, and not the respondents or the testator. They insist that there was probable cause of seizure, and therefore the captors are not answerable in damages. They also plead an abatement to the jurisdiction of the court, because they assert that the subject of prize or no prize belongs to the admiralty of New Jersey, and not to this court, which has no cognizance of the question, nor has it power to effectuate its judgment against executors. On the part of the executors, particularly, an answer was put in denying their being chargeable for the torts of the testator, which as well as their consequences die with his person. But, on an explanation on the behalf of the libellant, that he claimed no damages for the tort merely as a tort, but sought for restitution of his property only, this point was abandoned by the advocates for the respondents. The libellant, to repel this defence, and denying in the usual form the facts as stated, sets forth the reversal of the judgment of the court of Jersey by the court of appeals of the United States on the 23d of December, 1780, which contains a direction to the latter court to make restitution of the property with costs but not damages. They also join issue on the point of jurisdiction; and distinguish between a suit commenced in the life-time of the testator, and one brought, in the first instance, against the executor. Five points were made by the advocates for the respondents: (1) The tort dying with the person. (2) The jurisdiction of this court is not competent, as it is not a prize court. (3 and 4) If a prize court, yet, as the cause originally attached in the court of Jersey, that was the only court in which the consequences are cognizable; and is alone competent to effectuate the decree of the court of appeals. (5) A capture with probable cause is not a subject of action for damages.\nThe first point being waved brings the question to the competency of jurisdiction, which, in order as well as necessity, should be the first point considered, because, if the court has no jurisdiction, it is nugatory to enquire into the merits of the cause.\nOn this point, as it first struck me, I confess I had doubts. The account given by Lord Mansfield of the arrangement of the court of admiralty in England, as in the Case of Lindo and Rodney. 2 Doug. C13, note (1 Williams, Abr. 403), produced hesitation; and my respect for the opinion of that great character, as well as the arguments of the advocates in the present cause, induced a deliberate consideration of the subject. The division of the court of admiralty, into two sides, prize and instance, until I saw this case, appeared new to me;\n3\nand it is allowed not to have been generally known, If at all, | to the common lawyers in England, before that case was determined. In this country it never was known, nor does it appear that any new commission was ever transmitted to j the colonial judge of the admiralty from ! Great Britain before the Revolution, in case:; ! of wars between that kingdom and its ene- ' mies. I have traced, from records and other i authentic information, the proceedings of the ' admiralty court of Pennsylvania, for a pe- , riod exceeding fifty years: and I have the \u00a1 best reasons for believing, that the practice in other colonies was similar; in all the proceedings, prize-suits are called suits civil and maritime. During the late war, when we .assumed and effected our independence, the 1 proceedings were unaltered in ihis point. I \u00a1 \u25a0do not find that there is any such distinction in any other nation, except it should be found in Holland; and of this I much doubt. The \u25a0authority, out of Bynkershoek, produced by j \u25a0one of the advocates for the respondent, j founded on an ordinance of the Earl of Eei- j \u25a0cester, shews that there is a court there, \u00a1 whose authority is entirely confined to cap- . tures as prize, and it has no jurisdiction even . \u25a0of other maritime cases. This, therefore, is ' not applicable to a question concerning the ; powers of a court of admiralty; which is al- \u00a1 lowed, even in the Case of Lindo and Rod- \u00a1 \u2022ney to possess jurisdiction in all maritime i \u2022cases: though in England it is said to act ; under a peculiar (and therefore, not a general- i ly known) organization; I take it, therefore, \u00a1 for granted, because the contrary has not i been shewn, that, in England alone, are these ; \u2022distinct. branches of the same court to be I found. In all the books of reports, in which | \u25a0cases of prohibitions to the admiralty are | mentioned, precedent to the .Case of Lindo ' .\u2022and Rodney, these prohibitions are moved I for and granted generally to the court of ad- i miralty; though, in a case in Term Reports I (long after the Case of Lindo and Rodney) \u00a1 the distinction is taken (3 Term R. 323: 1 . Williams, Abr. 4(>6>. and the prohibition \u25a0 moved for to the prize court. This very in- ! \u25a0stance shews it to be a novelty, in the com- \u00a1 mon law courts there: for if it had been I known as an old practice, the particular desig- i nation of the prize court, would have been ' unnecessary; and the prohibition would have < been granted to the admiralty, generally, as ! it ever had been in former cases. Acting as we now do in a national, and not a dependent i capacity. I cannot conceive that we are bound . to follow the practice in England, more than \u2018 that of our own, or any other nation.\n4\nCus- I toms purely colonial were parts of our laws even iii the times of our connections with Britain. 1 need instance only \u25a0 one. to wit, that of the inode of conveyance of femme coverts estates, contrary to the laws of England. [Davey v. Turner] 1 Dall. [1 U. S.] 11; [Lloyd v. Taylor] Id. 17. This is a case at common law, in which we then were, and now are. particularly called to follow their rules and practice in general. The admiralty proceeds by a law which considers all nations as one community, and should not be tied down to the precedent of one nation; though it were more clearly ascertained. I shall therefore conclude that, if the powers of an admiralty and maritime court are delegated by congress to this court, those of a prize court are mixed in the mass of authority with which it is invested; and requires no particular specification. They are called forth, if generally delegated, by the occasion; and not by repeated and new interferences of government. Nor do I believe that, even in England, any new authority is vested; though a kind of legal and solemn notice is given of a war, in which subjects for the prize authority of admiralty may occur. It does not begin with their wars, but was pre-existent; it does not end with the commencement of peace, for their books shew it to be exercised at any time afterwards. Government never interferes to put an end to it; how then can its power be repeatedly necessary to begin it? The fact is, it is inherent in a court of admiralty; and not lost, but torpid, like other authorities of the court, when there are no occasions for its exercise. But here the question arises: \u201cHave congress, by their judiciary laws, vested this court with general or special admiralty powers?\u201d Congress have authority delegated by the people in the constitution in \u201call cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.\u201d The words of that part of the judicial?\u2019 law affecting this subject, in which the authorities of this court are described, will be seen in the ninth section of that law: It \"shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including seizures under laws of impost, navigation, or trade of the United States.\u201d It is said, prize or no prize is a question of a military, not a civil nature. But I find no such distinction in the books. 3 Bl. Connn. p. 09. Blaclcstone in his divisions of courts, does not class that of the admiralty as a military, but a maritime court: and it will appear, that the jurisdiction of prize is within its powers; \u2018though he points out. in cases of prizes in the then colonies, that appeals were to members of the privy council and others, in consequence of treaties and domestic arrangements. But he says, \u201cThe original court, to which this question is committed in England, is the court of admiralty, without any distinction as to the nature of its powers, whether instance or prize, military or civil. In book 3, p. IOS, he mentions the exclusive and undisturbed jurisdiction of the court of admiralty, in cases of prize, and that court determines not according to British laws or practice, but, \u201caccording to the laws of nations.\u201d Should I confine myself merely to the en-quiry, whether this could be classed under the description of a \u201ccivil cause,\u201d 1 should think there were grounds to support the idea of its being comprehended. In the Case of Atcheson and Everitt, Cowp. 3S2, some light is thrown on this view of the subject; because it appears, that a civil suit may, in substance. but not form, partake of criminal ingredients. So. by parity of reason, may a civil case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction be mixed with or grounded in transactions of a military nature; but I do not think it necessary nicely to fix this point.\n5\nWhat is, perhaps, of most consequence, is to ascertain the intention of congress in distributing a power, clearly in them, to their judiciary department; and what was said by one of the advocates for the libellant strikes me as being just and proper, viz. that the construction should be made from a consideration of all the laws on the subject in pari materia. \u201cThe court shall also have cognizance, &c.\u201d that is, being invested with criminal powers in certain cases, it shall also have civil powers as opposed to criminal in admiralty and maritime cases. By recurring to the 12th, 13th, 10th, 21st, & 30th sections of the judiciary laws, it will appear that congress meant to convey all the powers, and in the words of the constitution, as they possessed them in admiralty cases; and actions or suits in these cases can originate only in the district courts. For the foregoing reasons, and some others which might be added, I am of opinion that this court possesses all the powers of a court of admiralty, and that the question of prize is cognizable before it. I have gone thus far into the discussion of this point, because I believe it is the first time it has been agitated in a federal court. I do, therefore, decree, adjudge and determine, that the plea to the jurisdiction of the court, as not being competent to determine prize questions, be, and the same is, hereby overruled. As to the question on the legality, equity and propriety of the court\u2019s interference in the present suit to effectuate the decree of the court of appeals, and all other questions save that on which I have determined, I give no opinion, but hold them under advisement (unless the parties agree that I shall proceed under the present defect of proof in some points, and under some doubts I entertain concerning them) that an appeal may be lodged in the superior court, wherein I confess I should prefer an ultimate decision in a cause said to be important in itself and extensive in its consequences.\n6\n3 Notwithstanding this division of the court of admiralty of England was not generally known, because it had not then appeared so strongly marked, as to claim particular attention here, it is established from the'earliest periods of their judicial history. English common lawyers (and too many here) are only occasionally called to investigations into admiralty subjects. The instance court is the appropriate and real, or ordinary, court of admiralty. The prize court is only brought into activity by wars, and the incidents produced by them. It would have been fortunate for that country, as well as others, if that court had oeen one of less business, and of course less distinguished by the incessant occasions for the exercise of its power. It is customary to issue a commission to the same person, who is the ordinary judge of the high court of admiralty, on the commencement of hostilities. The instance court takes cognizance of the general subjects of \u00e1dmiralty jurisdiction, and proceeds agreeably to the civil or Roman law, the laws of Dieron, and established \u201cUsages and Customs of the Admiralty,\u201d as well as special and local regulations. The prize court has exclusive jurisdiction of captures, or prizes, in war, and local matters connected therewith. Its proceedings are generally according to the laws of nations: though in particular instances it is governed by local orders and occasional interferences of the executive authority, of disputable character, as thev respect the laws of nations. The line of distinction between these departments of the court is preserved through all the proceedings. Appeals are distinct, and made to separate tribunals. From the instance, they are prosecuted before delegates, appointed by the king, by commission issuing out of chancery. By 8 Eliz. c. 5, the decision of the delegates is final. Those trom the prize court lie to commissioners of appeal (mostly of the king\u2019s council) appointed by the crown for this special purpose only. By an arrangement, contrary to the spirit of their own constitutions, the greater proportion of these judges of appeals by their orders in council, make the laws on which they give judicial decisions. In 1748 the judges of the courts of Westminster were added to the commission for the dispatch of business, but by the 22 Geo. II. c. 3, no sentence given under a commission is valid, unless a majority of the commissioners present are actually privy counsellors. 3 Bl. Comm. 70. Their colonial courts are branches of the high court of admiralty, to which appeals lie from the instance side to the courts of admiralty in England, or from that of prize, to the lords commissioners of appeals. By a late arrangement (1801.) the British colonial courts of admiralty are placed on a footing more independent and just, both as it respects the judges and mode of appeal. \u2022 See the act of the British parliament on this subject printed in the appendix of Rob. Rep. Oas. 299. When I declared this division of the court \u201cappeared new to me.\u201d 1 should have said I did not- recollect it. My mind had been abstracted from the. subject. by a long occupation in the military and political affairs of our country. Having been register of the colonial court of admiralty before our Revolution, the knowledge of the English arrangement of the court, must have been once familiar to me; and habits of attention have since revived it, though it had been interrupted. It is certain, however, that the minutes or records of admiralty proceedings (in this country) were uniformly kept without regard to this dis-tinetion. Several nations, I now find, have sep- ! .urate courts for prize decisions, other than the ordinary admiralty or maritime tribunals. \u00a1 France has a distinct court. Holland distinct ! courts, in several provinces. So also has Spain. |\n4 This is a genera), but not entirely an accurate ! remark. The practice and laws of the admiral- I ty of England, as they existed before our Revo- l lution, were particularly imperative to us. The i arrangement of courts may be different: and | there are exceptions where our usages, well established. differ from those of that country: wherein the \"usages and customs of the admiralty.\u201d are not exclusively their own. but adopted front those, in many instances, of other nations.\n5 The period elapsed since this decision has been abundantly productive of events, which centuries, in past times, would have been occupied in evolving. We have been too intimately acquainted with the British prize courts, to have any doubts now about their arrangement. They are, however, part of the admiralty jurisdiction. Their subjects are \u201cmaritime acquisitions, earned and become due on the high seas.\u201d and their jurisdiction attaches \u201cob eausam a re mar\u00edtima ortum.\u201d Being the only department of their judiciary not entitled to our admiration, they furnish instances in which judicial decisions are -directed, and varied by executive interferences, in the form of arrettes, or orders of the king in council. They do not determine as they ought, In all cases, \u201caccording to the laws of nations,\u201d as Blackstone asserts; but. in too many points, according to the ebbs and flows of executive policy and opinion. These originate, are multiplied, or diminished, with the chances producing adverse or prosperous events in wars; and. by sudden and unexpected changes and severities, after relaxations of the rigors of their own regulations, neutrals are plunged into unforeseen difficulties, and frequent ruin. To them....who must become belligerent, or submit....the British law maxim is degradingly applicable, however indignantly felt. \u2014 \u201cMisera est servitus. ubi jus est vagum. aut incognitum.\u201d Their instance court is still properly separated from that of prize. And. being occupied only in private transactions, it preserves its purity; and administers impartial justice.\n6 This case on the point of jurisdiction went up. by consent to the circuit court. The judgment of the district court being affirmed, it came back, for decision upon its merits. But no decision was ever had, on the merits, by the district court. By consent it returned to the circuit court, which gave a decision in favour of the libellant: from which there is now an appeal depending, in the supreme court of the United States. This decision is now published, to shew that all the powers of a court of admiralty are vested in the district court. Some of the cases which follow have circumstances of a mixed character, requiring the jurisdiction to be complete on both the prize and instance sides of the admiralty court.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The State applied to be admitted to ailert her claim, but fhe application was rejedted ; nor has any writ of error been inftifuted upon the judgment. Thefe fa\u00a3tsr 'however, are only mentioned to introduce this remark, that th.e Circuit court could not, with propriety, fuftain' the application of Georgia'; becaufe, whenever a- State is \u00e1 party, the Supreme court- has exclufive jurifdidtion of the fuit ; and. her- right cannot be efFedtu\u00e1lly fupported, by a voluntary appearance, before any other tribunal of the Unions\u2019 Not being a party, nor capable of reforting as a party, to the Circuit court, it is v^ry much to be queftioned whether the State could bring'\u00bb writ of error on the judgment there, even if her claim appeared on the record.-\nEvery principle of law, juftice, and honor, however, feem to require, that jhe claim of the State of Georgia ihould not be, inr diredlly, decided, or defeated, byajudgment pronounced between parties, over whom fhe had no controul, and upon a trial, in which fhe was: not allowed to be heard. \u2022 If, indeed, the court could not devife.a mode, for admitting a fait inveftigation and determination upon that cla'im, it would be ufelefs to grant an injunction : \u215b But I think a mode may eafily be preferibed, in itridt conformity with the'pradticeand principles of equity.\nIt was in the power of the deTendant in the Circuit court, to have filed a bill of interpleader,- in order, for his own fafety, to-fettle .the rights of the contending .parties; but neither-in that form, nor by inftituting a fuit herfelf, could Georgia have derived the benefit of fuppo.rting her claim, in her own way, befpre any other -than the Supreme court. In this court, therefore, we ought now to place the State upon the fame footing, as if a bil\u00ed of interpleader Rad been regularly filed here; which can be done by fuftaining the prefent fuit; and when the parties are all before us, we. may''direct a, proper iflue to be formed, and tried at, the bar. Thus, juftice will be done to Geergia, and an irreparable injury may be prevented; while the adverfe party, even if he ultimately fucceeds, can only complain of a fliort delay.\n.

It is true, perhaps, as the counfe\u00ed has fuggefted, that the defendant below pleaded the confiication aft of Georgia in bar to the aftion; but it is a fufficient .anfwer to this argument, that the State was not a party; and no right can be defeated,, in law, unlefs. the party claiming it, has himfelfan opportunity to fuppo'rt it.\nIf the State of Georgia was entitled to the bond, ffie is equally-entitled to the money levied by the marihall in fatisfaftion of the bond, or'rather of the judgment rendered upon it: Andas' the execution direfts the marihall to pay.the amount to the plaintiffs b\u00e9low, I can perceive no other mode of preventing a compli-\u215b06, while we enquire into the right of receiving the'money,' than that of iffuing an injunftion to ftay it in the hands \u00f3f the officer. -\nIt appears to me to be too early, like wife,pronounce an opinion upon the titles in colli\u00edion; fince it is enough, on a motion of this kind, to \u00edhew a colorable title.- The State of Georgia has. fet up her confiication aft, which certainly is' a fair foundation for future judicial inveftigation; and that an injury ni ay not be . done, which it may be out of our power to repair, the injunftion ought, I think, to iffue, till we are enabled, by a, full enquiry, to decide upon the whole merits-of-the cafe.\nWilson, JuJHce.\nI confefs, -that -I have not been able to form .an opinion which is perfeftly fatisfaftory to my own mind, upon the points that have been difeuffed. If Georgia has a right to the bond, it is ftriftly a legal right; but to enforce a ftriftly legal right, the prefent feems, at the fitil bluffi, to \u00bd an '.awkward and irregular proceeding. Again : Georgia had not a right, or ihe had a right, . to be admitted to a hearing in the Circuit court: but, in the former cafe, it would be no ground of complaint, that her application wasrejeftedq for, ihe is bound by the law; and in the other cafe, ihe would be entitled to bring the fubjeft before us, as a court of law ; fince fire was refufed the exercife of a. legal right.\nIt is true, that, under the Federal Conftitution, an Inferior tribunal cannot compel a State to appear-as a party; but it is a-very different proportion to' fay, that a State cannot, by her oWa confent, appear in any other court, than' the Supreme court. The general rule applies among all fovereigns, --who, as equals, are not amenable'to courts of each other;- and yet I remember an aftion was inftituted and fuftained, fome years ago, in the name of Louts XVI. king of France, againft -Mr. Robert Morris-, in the Supreme court of. Pennfylvania.\n\u25a0 Under thefe impreilions, I am difpofed to think, that the State' of Georgia ought rather to have fued out a writ of error, Shan to have aflsed for an-injunftion; But flail,' in.the exifting circumftances of the cafe, I have no objection to retain- the mb-ney witliin the- power of the qourt, \u2019till we can better fatisfy ourfelves both as to the remedy and.the right.\nCushing, JuJlice.\nThe Judicial aft expreisly declares, that \u201c fuits in equity ihall not be fuftained, in either of the courts of the United St\u00e1tes, in any cafe where.plain, adequate,' and. complete remedy may be had at law.\u201d Now, if Georgia -has any right to the debt in queftxon, it is a right'at law, for which, of courfe, the law will furni\u00edh a plain, adequate, and complete remedy. The.decifion of the Circuit dourt, in a cafe to which .Georgia\u20191was neither..party -nor privy,- did n\u00f3t, and could not, take away either the right or the remedy, of the- State. Nor can Spalding, the defendant below, be made liable twice, for the fame debt, without his wilful laches. For, if is in his power to bring a writ of error; and then the whole merits of the claim of Georgia appearing on the record, we mult dec\u00edde-it as a queftion of law, either by affirming or reverfing the judgment, fo as to bind us in any fuft, which Georgia might inftitute for the fame caufe.

'the whole Iegiflative power of the United States is not veiled. An important part of that power was.exercifed by the people themfelves, when they \u201c ordained and eflabliihed the Conftitution.\u201d\n\u201c This Conftitution is \u201c the Supreme Law of the Land.\u201d . This fopreme law \u201call judicial officers of .the United States are bound, by oath or affirmation, to fupport.\u201d-\n\u201c It is a principle important to freedom,' that in government, the judicial ffipuld.be diftinft from, and-independent of, the leg \u00a1ilativo de-. partment. To this important principle the people of the United States, in formingtbeir Conftitution, have manifeile'd the higheilregard.\n\u201c They have placed-their judicial power not in Congrefs, but in \u201c \u25a0courts.'\u201d- They have- ordained that the \u201c Judges of -tbofe courts-\u00edhall hold their, offices during good behaviour,\u201d and that \u201cduring-their continuance in office, their falaries ftiall not be diminiihed.\u201d\n\u201c Congrefs have lately paffed an aft, to. regulate, among other tilings, \u201c the claims to invalid penfions.\u201d\n\u201c Upon due c.onfidera-tion, we have been unanimotifly of opinion, that, under this \u00e1ft, the Circuit courtheld for-the Pennfylvania dif-\u2022trift could not proceed;.\n\u201c ill. Becaufe the bufinefs direfled by this aft is not of a-judicial nature. It forms no part of the power veiled by the Coni! itution -in the courts of the United States; the Circuit court muff, confequently, have proceeded skit bout conilitutionfLauthority.\n\u201c ad. Becaufe, if, upon that bufinefs, the court had proceeded, its judgments (for its opinions are its judgments) might, under the lame aft, have been revifed and controuled by the legiilatufe, and by an officer in the executive department; Such revifion and c\u2019ontroul we-deemed radically incoiiiiiterst with the independence of that judiciaL power, which is veiled in the .courts j and, confequently, with that \u215b portant principle which is fo flriftly obferved by the Conditution of the United States.\n\u201c Thefe, Sir, are th\u00e9 reafons of our condo ft. Be allured that, though it .became neceifary, it was far from being plea fan t. To be obliged to aft contrary, either to the obvious direftions of Congrefs, or to a conttitutional principle, in our judgment equally obvious, excited feelings in us, -which we hope never to experience again.\u201d\nThe Circuit court for the diitrift of North Carolina, (confiding of Iredell, Justice, and Sitgreaves, Diitrift judge) made the following reprefentation in a letter jointly addreffed to the Prefident of the United States, on the 8th of June, 1792.\n\u201c We, the judges now attending at the Circuit court of the United States for the diitrift of North Carolina, conceive it our duty to lay before you fome important obfer/vations which have occurred to us in the Confideration of an aft of Congrefs lately palfed, entitled \u201c an aft to provide for the fettlement of the claims of widows and. orphans barred by the limitations heretofore eitabliihed, and to regulate the claims to invalid peniions.\n\u201c We beg leave to premife, that it is as much our inclination, as it is our duty, to receive with all poffible refpeft every aft of the Le-giilature, and that we never can find ourfelves in a more painful fitu-ation than to be obliged to objeft to; the execution of any, more efpe-cially to the execution of one founded on the pureft principles of humanity and juftice, Which the aft in queftion undoubtedly is. But, however lamentable s difference in opinion really.may be, or with whatever difficulty we may have formed an opinion, we are under the indifpenfable neceffity of afting according to the bed diftates of our own judgment, after duly weighing {\u00a1very confideration that can occur to us ; which we have done on the prefent occafion.\n\u201c The extreme importance of the cafe, and our defireof being explicit beyond the danger of being mifunderffood, will, we hope, juf-tify us inflating our obiervations in a fyflematic manner. Wc therefore, ..Sir, iubmit to you the following-\n\u201c 1. That the Legiilative, Executive, and Judicial departments, ar\u00e9 each formed in a ieparare and independent manner ; 'and that the ultimate Dafis of each is the Conditution-only, within the limits of which each department can alone judify any ait of authority.\n\u201c 2. That the Legiflature, among other important powers, unquef-tionably poffefs that of edablilhing courts in fuch a manner as totheir wifdom ihall appear bed, limited by the terms of the conilitution only; and to whatever extent that power may be exercifed, or however leyere the duty they may think proper to require, the Judges, when appointed in virtue of any fuch eftablifhment, owe implicit arid unre-lerved obedience to it.\n\u201c 3. That at the fame time fuch courts cannot be warranted, as we conceive, by virtue of that part of the Conditution delegating judicial power, for the exercife.'of which-any act of the legidature is provided, in e^ercifing (even under the authority of another art) any power not in its nature judicial, or, if judicial, not provided for upon the terms the Confutation requires.\n\u2022 \u201c 4. That whatever doubt may be fuggefted, whether the power in queflion is properly of a judicial nature, yet inafmuch as the decilion.. of the court is not made final, but may be at leaf! fufp.ended in' its \u2022operationby the Secretary at War, if he fhall have caufe tofufpect impofition or miftake ; this fubjects the decifion of the court to a mode of revilion which we confider to be unwarranted by the Conl'i-tution ; for, though Congrefs may certainly e\u00edt\u00f3bli\u00edli, in inftances not yet provided for, courts of appellate juril\u2019diction, yet fuch courts mult confift of judges appointed in the manner the Coriftiuition requires, \u25a0 and holding their offices by no other tenure than that of their good behaviour, by which tenure the office of Secretary at War is not held. And we beg leave to add, with all due deference, that no deci- \u2022 fion of any court of the United States can, under any circumflances, in cur opinion, agreeable to the Conilitution, be liable to a reverfion, or even fiifpenfion, by the Legiflature itfelf, in whom no judicial power of any kind appears to be-veiled, but the important one relative'to impeachments.\ns\u2018 Thefe, fir, are our reafons for being of opinion, as we are atpre-fen't, that this Circuit court cannot be juftified in the execution of that part of the act, which requires it to examine and report an opinion on the unfortunate cafes of officers and foidiers-difabled in the fervice of the United States. The part of the act requiring the court to fit five days, for the purpoie of receiving applications from fuch perfons, we fhall deem it our duty to comply with; for,.whether in our opinion-fuch purpofe can or cannot be anfwered, it is, as we conceive, our indifpenfable duty to keep open any court of which we have the honor \u2019 to fee judges, as long as Congrefs fhall direct.\n\u201c The high refpect we entertain for the Legiflature, our feelings as men for perfons, whofe fituation requires the earlieft, as well as the . moft effectual relief, and our fincere delire to promote, whether officially or otherwife, the juft and benevolent views of Congrefs, locon-fpicuous on the prefent as well as on many other occafions, have indu- . ced us to reflect, whether we could be juftified in acting,\u2019 under this act, perfonally in the character of commiffioners during the feflion of a .court; and could w\u00e9 be fatisfied that we had authority to do for wc would cheerfully devote fuch part of our time-as might be necelfary for the performance of the fervice. But we cont\u00e9is we have great doubts on this head. The powerappears to be given to the court on-1 ji and not to the Judges of it; and as the Secretary at War has not a difcretion in all inftances, but only in thofe where lie has caufe to . fufpect impofition or millake, to with-hold a perfon recommended by' the court from being named on the penllon lilt, it would be necelfary for us to be well perfuaded we pafle\u00edled inch an authority, before we. exercifedapower, which might be a means of drawing money out of the public treafury as effectually as an exprefs appropriation by law. W\u00e9 do not mean, however,- to precliide ourfelves from a very, deliberate eonficleratibn, whether we can-be warranted'in executing the-purpofes of the act in that manner, in cafe an application ihould.be made..\n\"No application has yet been.made to-the court, or to ouifelves-individually, and therefore we have had forne doubts as to the propriety of giving an opinion in a cafe which.lias not yet come regularly and judicially before us..

The prisoner was a French sailor, and the murder with which he stood charged had been committed upon the high seas. On his landing in North Carolina he was taken up and committed to jail. From thence he was taken on the next day, brought into court in irons, and examined, without being informed that he was then under an examination and not on his trial. He understood not the English language, and no one informed him of what was passing. There was room to believe that he thought, when he was remanded to jail, that he had been tried, convicted, and condemned, for he asked a person who understood the French language on what day he was to be executed. The counsel said although in the case of a person who had resided some time in this country, or in others in which the proceedings are carried on by jury, the objection would be frivolous, yet it must have weight in the case of a foreigner unacquainted with our laws and our language; that what the prisoner had seen in court, except perhaps the confrontation of witnesses, was all that in familiar circumstances he would have seen in his own country had he been tried there, where sentence of death is not pronounced in court in presence of the prisoner, but read to him afterwards by the clerk in the dungeon.\n2.

For, by the opinion of some judges now living, the statute does not extend to the examination of the party accused unless he signed his examination, but only to the witnesses or persons accusing.

And this must receive its answer from the solution of a third question; whether, according to the constitution of the United States, the authority to naturalize is exclusive, or concurrent? We are of opinion, then, that the states, individually, still enjoy a concurrent authority upon this subject;\n2\nbut that their individual authority cannot be exercised, so as to contravene the rule established by the authority of the Union. The objection founded on the word \u201cuniform,\u201d and the arguments ab inconvenient!, have been carried too far. It is, likewise, declared by the constitution (article 1, \u00a7 8) that all duties, imposts and exercises shall be uniform throughout the United States; and yet, if the express words of exclusion had not been inserted, as in a subsequent part of the same article (section 10) the individual states would still, undoubtedly, have been at liberty, without the consent of congress, to lay and collect duties and imposts. Again, when it is said that one state ought not to be privileged to admit obnoxious citizens, to the injury of another, it should be recollected that the state which communicates the infection must herself be first infected; and in this, as in all other cases, we may be assured that the principle of self-preservation will inculcate every reasonable precaution.\nThe true reason for investing congress with the power of naturalization has been assigned at the bar. It was to guard against too narrow, instead of too liberal, a mode of conferring the rights of citizenship. Thus the individual states cannot exclude those citizens who have been adopted by rthe United States; but they can adopt citizens upon easier terms, than those which congress may deem it expedient to impose. But the act of congress itself, furnishes a strong proof that the power of naturalization is concurrent. In the concluding proviso, it is declared, \u201cthat no person heretofore proscribed by any state, shall be admitted a citizen as aforesaid, except by an act of the legislature of the state, in which such person was proscribed.\u201d Here we find that congress has not only circumscribed the exercise of its own authority, but has recognized the authority of a state legislature, in one case, to admit a citizen of the United States, which could not be done in any ease, if the power of naturalization, either by its own nature, or by the manner of its being vested in the federal government, was an exclusive power. Upon the whole, the court think that the plea to the jurisdiction has been maintained; and, therefore, the bill must be dismissed.\n3\n2 Quere? See 2 Dall. 373 [U. S. v. Parker, Case No. 15,992],\n3 It is remarkable that the argument in this case turned entirely upon the point whether the federal power of naturalization was exclusive or concurrent; and nothing was said by either side respecting the existence and operation of the act of Pennsylvania, which, as it depended in form and spirit on the old constitution, was virtually repealed when that constitution was abolished. The ideas of the reporter on that subject are contained in a note upon the naturalization laws of Pennsylvania in his edition of the acts of the general assembly (volume 1, p. 7a). It may be proper to add that there has since been a decision before Judge Biddle, in the common pleas of Philadelphia county, where the existence of the Pennsylvania law was the gist of the controversy; and in that case, as well as the case of U.

The respondent in his plea averred, that the complainant was a citizen of Pennsylvania; and this plea, if true, deprived the court of its jurisdiction, as the federal courts_ cannot (unless in some particularly specified cases) take cognizance of controversies between citizens of the same state. The question was argued on the 21st of April by Randolph and Serjeant, in support of the bill, and by M. Levy in support of the exception to the jurisdiction. It then appeared, that the complainant was bom in the Isle of Man, part of the British dominions; but it was certified, by the mayor of Philadelphia, that on the 30th of April, 1790, he had taken the oath of allegiance to the state of Pennsylvania, agreeably to an act of the general assembly, passed the 13th of March, 1789. 2 Dali.

This object would, therefore, be most effectually attained, by leaving the authority of the individual states unimpaired; and as there is nothing exclusive in the nature of the power, so neither is there anything exclusive in the manner of vesting it in the federal government. Though \u201ccongress shall have power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization\u201d (article 1, \u00a7 8), it does not necessarily follow, that each state \u2022of the confederacy may not, likewise, exercise the power of adopting aliens upon its own terms. That an opinion prevails here, in favor of the state jurisdiction, must be inferred from the various laws, which Pennsylvania, even subsequent to the naturalization act of congress, passed 26th of March, 1790 [1 Stat. 103], has enacted, respecting the rights that aliens may enjoy within her territory. 3 Dali. Edit. 9, 183, 653. Nor is there any force in the argument that the jurisdiction in maritime and admiralty cases is exclusively vested in the federal government, without the use of exclusive words; for those in their nature are exclusive, belong appropriately to the national character, and arise extraterritorially of any state; whereas naturalization is merely a municipal and domestic concern. In opposition to the plea it was urged that contemplating the present situation of the United States, the birth of the complainant had made him an alien; and that in order to change the condition of alienage into that of citizenship, the interposition of a competent constitutional and legislative authority' was indispensable. This authority, throughout the United States, resides in the federal government alone; for, the power of naturalization (which is given by the 8th section of' the first article of the constitution) does of itself import exclusion. That one member of the Union should be able to disturb all the rest, by the introduction of obnoxious characters, was an evil- to be prevented, and no effectual mode could be adopted to obviate the inconveniences of different systems and regulations in different states, short of' giving to congress the exclusive power of establishing an uniform rule of naturalization. Exclusive words were not necessary in this case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,, which is, nevertheless, allowed to be exclusively vested in the general government without the use of such words. If, therefore, congress had the exclusive power to admit citizens, that power being exercised by the act of the 26th March, 1790, the naturalization, under an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, was a mere nullity, and the complainant remains a subject of the British crown.\nCase No. 3,001.\nNaturalization \u2014 State Authobitt.\nAn individual state still possesses concurrent authority with congress upon the subject of naturalization; but this authority cannot be so used as to contravene a rule established by the latter.\n[Cited in U.

EATON."], "judges": ["Before ELLSWORTH, Circuit Justice, and S1TGREAVES, District Judge."], "opinions": [{"text": "SITGREAVES, District Judge.\nThis is an action of debt brought by the plaintiffs, to recover of the defendant on an obligation made in the year 1776. The defendant has pleaded four several pleas in bar, which are now for the decision of the court by demurrer. I shall consider of the case as it appears by the first plea, which places the defendant on the most advantageous ground, as a decision on that will probably govern all the cases arising out of the subsequent pleas. The case as it appears by the first plea is as follows: The plaintiffs were merchants, residents of North Carolina, before and at the time of the Declaration of lnde-pendence. . By an act of the legislature of North Carolina, passed in April, 1777, it was among other things enacted \u201cthat all persons being subjects of this state, and now living therein, or who shall hereafter come to live therein, who have traded immediately to Great Britain or Ireland, within ten years last past, in their own right, or acted as factors, storekeepers, or agents here, or in any of the United States of America.' for merchants residing in Great Britain or Ireland, shall take \u00e1n oath of abjuration and allegiance, or depart out of the state.\u201d By the same act, such persons were permitted to sell their estates, to export the amount thereof in produce, and to appoint attorneys to sell and dispose of their estates for their use and benefit. The plaintiffs falling within the description of persons contemplated by this act, and refusing to take the oath, departed the state, the debt which is the subject of the present suit then existing. By subsequent acts of the legislature, all the estates, rights, properties, and debts of certain persons, among which the plaintiffs are specially named, are declared to be confiscated, and the debts due to such persons are directed to be paid to certain commissioners, to be appointed by the county courts for that purpose, by all persons within the state owing the same, under pain of imprisonment, which payment it is declared shall forever indemnify and acquit the persons paying the same, their heirs, etc., against any future claim for the money mentioned in the receipts or discharges of such commissioners. In obedience to those acts, the defendant paid the debt in question to the commissioners authorized to receive it, and relies on that payment as legal, and a full and sufficient discharge; the plaintiffs admitting the fact of payment as legal on the construction of the treaty of peace, the constitution of the United States declaring that treaty to be part of the law of the land. The counsel for the plaintiffs in support of this claim has, in the coui\u2019se of his argument, presented to the view a doubt whether the debt in the present question has been confiscated in a strictly legal sense, by any of the acts called confiscation acts, and has urged the doubt strenuously, and with much force of argument, contemplating them as a body of penal law, and of course subject to the legal rules of construction in such cases. The observations on that point would merit much attention, but I deem it not absolutely necessary to investigate that question in forming an opinion of the present ease, and shall confine my observations solely to the law and the facts, as they arise out of the pleadings in the first plea of the defendant, which admits alone of this question, viz.: Are the plaintiffs barred of recovery?\nIt would appear quite unnecessary to inquire whether congress, under whose authority the treaty was negotiated, was vested by the state with a power competent to enter into such a contract, had not part of the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel seemed to require it. No one will doubt if they had the power, the treaty consequently became obligatory on the people of the United States when made and duly ratified. Whatever agreement the states may have entered into at the Declaration of Independence, and to what purposes and extent that agreement may or may not have bound them,, as a confederated body, it is clear that at a subsequent period, and previous to the negotiation of this treaty, they by their delegates in congress formed and entered into a solemn compact, by which they plight and engage the faith of their constituents to abide by the determination of the United States in congress assembled on all questions which by the confederation are submitted to them; and that the articles thereof shall be invariably observed by the states. Among many other portions of sovereignty which the states thought proper to deposit in that confederated head was the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war (except in certain cases specially enumerated), of sending and receiving ambassadors, entering into treaties and alliances. No words can be more comprehensible or express relative to the point in question; nor is there offered to my mind the least room of doubt. Admitting, for argument\u2019s sake, what has been contended, that the ministers who negotiated the treaty exceeded the powers granted them, certainly the ratification of that instrument by congress confirmed and legalized all that had been done by them; and if it could be supposed, as has been said, that congress in the ratification of it exceeded the powers vested in them by the state, the act of assembly of this state passed in 17S7 must have extinguished every scintilla of doubt as to its validity and obligatory force on them citizens. That act is a perfect recognition of the whole treaty, declares it to be part of the law of the land, and directs the judges to decide accordingly. The last-mentioned act must surely be sufficient to satisfy the mind of the most scrupulous and skeptical. For myself, I do not hesitate to declare that it adds nothing to the validity and legality of the treaty; that its ratification by congress was alone sufficient, and that the act of assembly of the state was superfluous.\nThe counsel for the defendant has contended that by the operation of the acts of confiscation and the payment into the .treasury, the plaintiffs were wholly divested of their right, and the same, if existing at all, was vested in the state. This fofins a material part of his defence, and if it had been clearly evinced that the right of the \u25a0 plaintiffs was wholly extinguished by the operation of the confiscation acts, and could not possibly be revived or restored by any subsequent act of the state or the nation, it would follow of course that they could have no demand against the defendant. In support of this argument, it is said (4 Bac. Abr. (537) that all acts done under a statute while in force are good notwithstanding a subsequent repeal. I am ready to admit the principle in its fullest extent, in the exposition of a statute or municipal law of any particular state. It is consonant with reason, and is justified by the necessity of the case. It prevents much confusion and embarrassment, and insures a ready submission to the laws, by a confidence in the security impliedly promised to such obedience. If the treaty was now to be considered as an act of the state, and emanating from the same authority only that produced the acts of confiscation, this reasoning might be solid. But such an instrument as the treaty of 17S3 cannot be subject to the ordinary rules of construction which govern the exposition of statutes of a particular state. They have for their object the regulation of the rights of a distinct community or society only, whose interests being similar, are equally affected by a uniform regulation of their rights; who are alike united by the allegiance due to and protection from the same government. That is not the case with a compact formed between two separate and distinct nations, relative to certain specified subjects which involve interests of their respective citizens or people, unavoidably clashing with each other. The one is an act of a state, but a component part of the nation providing for the benefit of its own citizens. The other a compact of the whole nation (of which that state is but a part) with another nation which must necessarily control all acts issuing from the inferior authority which might contravene it. This is evinced by that plain and strong expression in the constitution of the United States, which declares that all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby; anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.\nTaking it for granted, then, that the treaty is not to be governed, when in opposition to particular laws, by the rigid rules of the common law, nor to be restrained in its operation by any statute of any particular state, \u201cbut that it ought to be interpreted in such manner as that it may have its effect, and not be found vain and illusive,\u201d I -vyill proceed to consider of the operation of the 4th article; \u201cArt. 4th. It is agreed that creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\u201d This article appears to me so clear, precise, and definite that one would be at some loss to select other words to render it more so. But it has been contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel that by a true construction of this article, it will appear much less general than the expressions would warrant; that it is a provision for real British subjects only, that is, persons resident in Great Britain at the commencement of the war; a term used in contradistinction to many other descriptions of people who in the course of the war took part with that nation; and that this construction is justified by the term \u201csterling money.\u201d In order to support this exposition a reference has been had to the 5th and Gth articles. The 4th article contains the only stipulation with respect to debts. In the whole instrument it is mutual and general in its expression, not limited or restrained by any particular words to any description of persons, as is evident in the 5th article. If that had been in the contemplation of the parties, they could not have overlooked the necessity for these distinctions, nor are we at liberty to presume it. In the next article the distinction is made with great accuracy with regard to those who may endeavor to procure a restitution of their lands and other property. With respect to the expression sterling money, it appears to me that was probably concluded on as a standard whereby to estimate the value of money due, it being no doubt apprehended that a depreciated paper medium circulated in many states of the Union, the nominal sum in which might not produce the intrinsic value of the debt due.\nAnother construction has been placed on this article, equally, in my opinion, unfounded with the foregoing. It has been said the article was only intended to take off from British subjects their disability as alien enemies to sue. Every one knows that disability can only exist during the continuance of a war; it would have been, therefore, unnecessary to provide for it in a treaty of peace, when it is obvious the peace itself, agreeably to the long-established principles of law, removed all such disability without any special stipulation. The word \u201crecovery\u201d admits of such an idea. The terms \u201csue\u201d and \u201crecover\u201d have very different import in practice. The difference is daily exemplified in our courts, and the distinction appears evident in the body of that instrument. In the latter part of the 5th article it is stipulated that certain persons shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights. In the 4th article the words are, \u201cno lawful impediment to the recovery of their debts.\u201d The distinction is obvious, and the terms aptly applied in each case. In the former, relative to lands and other property which had been confiscated, and a restoration of which entirely depended on the liberality of the legislatures, the term \u201crecovery\" would have been improper; in the latter, in which a payment to the creditor was positively stipulated, the expression is correct. Yat-tel says (page 3C9): \u201cWhen an act is conceived in clear and precise terms, when the sense is manifest and leads to nothing absurd, there can be no reason to refuse the sense which this treaty presents; to go elsewhere in search of conjectures, in order to \u25a0extinguish or restrain it, is to endeavor to elude it.\u201d It is therefore my opinion that this article does control the operation of the .acts of confiscation relative to debts; that the plaintiffs in this case are entitled to recover on the first demurrer, the plea in that case being the strongest ground of defence made by the defendant; that, therefore, judgment be given for the plaintiffs on each of the demurrers. The state, who has compelled the payment from the creditor by a threat of severe punishment, will certainly feel bound by every principle of moral obligation to reimburse, in the most ample manner, all those who have made such payments. In addition to the moral tie that it is bound by, a solemn promise so to do is clearly expressed by an act of the legislature. I have \u25a0only to observe that I have considered this case as of the utmost importance; that I have given it all the attention and consideration in my power to bestow at this time and place; that if my opinion is founded in error, which is possibly the case, happily for the defendant there is a higher tribunal where the error may be corrected.\nELLSWORTH, Circuit Justice.\nIt is admitted that the bond on which this suit is brought was executed by the defendant to the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs have not been paid. But the defendant pleads that since the execution of the bond a war has existed, in which the plaintiffs were enemies, and that during the war this debt was confiscated, and the money paid into the treasury of the state; and the plaintiffs reply that, by the treaty which terminated the war, it was stipulated that creditors \u201con either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\u201d\nDebts contracted to an alien are not extinguished by the intervention of a war with his nation. His remedy is suspended while the war lasts, because it would be dangerous to admit him into the country, or to correspond with agents in it, and also because a transfer of the treasure from the country to his nation would diminish the ability of the former, and increase that of the latter, to prosecute the war. But with the termination of hostilities these reasons, and the suspension of the remedy, cease. As to the confiscation here alleged, it is doubtless true that enemy\u2019s debts, so far as consists in barring the creditor and compelling payment from the debtors for the use of the public, can be confiscated, and that on principles of equity, though perhaps not of policy, they may be, for their confiscation, as well as that of property of any kind, may serve as an indemnity for the expenses of war, and as a security against future aggression. That such confiscations have fallen into disuse, has resulted, not from the duty to which one nation, independent of treaties, owes to another, but from commercial policy, which European nations have found a common, and, indeed, a strong interest in supporting. Civil war, which terminates in a severance of empire, does, perhaps less than any other, justify the confiscation of debts, because of the special relation and confidence subsisting at the time they were contracted, and it may have been owing to this consideration, as well as others, that the American States, in the late Revolution, so generally forbore to confiscate the debts of British subjects. In Virginia they were only sequestered; in South Carolina all debts, to whomsoever due, were excepted from confiscation; as were in Georgia those of British merchants and others residing in Great Britain. And in thq other states, except this, I do not recollect that British debts were touched. Certain it is that the recommendation of congress on the subject of confiscation did not extend to them. North Carolina, however, judging for herself, in a moment of severe pressure, exercised the sovereign power of passing an act of confiscation, which extended among otilers, to the debts of the) plaintiffs, providing, however, at the same time, as to all debts which should be paid into the treasury under that act, that the state would indemnify the debtors should they be obliged to pay again.\nAllowing then, that the debt in question was in fact and of right confiscated, can the plaintiffs recover by the treaty of 1783? The 4th article of that treaty is in the following words: \u201cIt is agreed that creditors on either side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\u201d There is no doubt but the debt in question was a \u201cbona fide\u201d debt, and theretofore contracted, i. e., prior to the treaty. To bring it within the article, it is also requisite that the debtor and creditor should have been on different sides with reference to the parties to the treaty; and, as the defendant was confessedly a citizen of the United States, it must appear that the plaintiffs were subjects of the king of Great Britain; and it is pretty clear, from the pleadings and the laws of the state, that they were so. It is true, that on the 4th of July, 1770, when North Carolina became an independent state, they were inhabitants thereof, though natives of Great Britain; and they might have been claimed and holden as citizens, whatever were their sentiments or inclination. But the state afterwards, in 1777, liberally gave to them with others similarly circumstanced, the option of taking an oath of allegiance, or of departing the state under a prohibition to return, with the indulgence of a time to sell their estates, and collect and remove their effects. They chose the latter, and ever after adhered to the king of Great Britain, and must therefore be regarded as on the British side. It is also pertinent to the inquiry whether the debt in question be within the before recited article, to notice an objection which has been stated by the defendant, viz., that at the date of the treaty, what is now sued for as a debt, was not a debt but a nonentity; payment having been made, and a discharge effected under the act of confiscation, and therefore that the stipulation concerning debts did not reach it. In the first place it is not true that in this case there was no debt at the date of the treats7. A debt is created by contract, and exists until the contract is performed. Legislative interference to exonerate a debtor from the performance of his contract, whether upon or without conditions, or to take from the creditor Ihe protection of law, does not in strictness destroy the debt, though it may, locally, the remedy for it \u2022 The debt remains, and in a foreign country payment is frequently enforced. Secondls7, it was manifestly the design of the stipulation that where debts had been theretofore contracted there should be no bar to their recovery from the operation of laws passed subsequent*to the contracts. And to adopt a narrower construction would be to leave creditors to a hardei fate than they have been left to by any modern treaty.\nUpon a view then of all the circumstances of this case, it must be considered as one within the stipulation that there should be \u201cno lawful impediment to a lawful recovery.\u201d And it is not to be doubted that impediments created by the act of confiscation are lawful impediments. They must therefore be disregarded if the treaty is a rule of decision. Whether it is so or not remains to be considered. Here it is contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the confiscation act has not been repealed by the state; that the treaty could not repeal or annul it; and therefore that it remains in force, and secures the defendant. And further, that a repeal of it would not take from him a right vested, to stand discharged. As to the opinion that a treaty does not annul a statute, so far as there is an interference, it is unsound. A statute is a declaration of the public will and of high authority, but it is controlled by the public will subsequently declared. Hence the maxim that when two statutes are opposed to each other, the latter abrogates the former. Nor is it material as to the effect of the public will, what organ it is declared by, provided it be an organ constitutionally authorized to make the declaration. A treaty, when it is in fact made, is, with regard to each nation that is a party to it, a national act, an expression of the national will as much so as a statute can be. And it does, therefore, of necessity annul any prior statute so far as there is an interference. The supposition that the public can have two wills at the same time, repugnant to each other, one expressed by a statute, and another by a treaty, is absurd.\nThe treaty now under consideration was made on the part of the United States, by a congress composed of deputies from each stale, to whom were delegated by the articles of confederation, expressly, \u201cthe sole and exclusively right and power of entering into treaties and alliances;\u201d and being ratified and made by them, it became a complete national act and law of every state. If, however, a subsequent sanction of this state was at all necessary to make the treaty law here, it has been had and repeated. By a statute passed in 17S7, the treaty was declared to be law in this state, and the courts of law and equity were enjoined to govern their decisions accordingly. And in 1789 was adopted here the present constitution of the United States, which declared that all treaties made, or which should be made, under the authority of the United States, should be the supreme law of the land, and that the judges in every state should be bound thereby; anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding. Surely, then, the treaty is now law in this state, and the confiscation act, so far as the treaty interferes with it, is annulled. Still it is urged, that annulling the confiscation act cannot annul the defendant\u2019s right of discharge, against which the act was in force. It is true, that the repeal of a law does not make void what has been well done under it. But it is also true, admitting the right here claimed by the defendant to be as substantial as a right of property can bo. that he may be deprived of it, if the treaty so requires. It is justifiable and frequent, in the adjustment of national differences, to concede for the safety of the state, the rights of individuals. And they are afterwards indemnified or not according to circumstances. What is most material to be here noted is that the right or obstacle in question, whatever it may amount to, has been created by law, and not by the creditors. It comes within the description of \u201clawful impediments,\u201d all of which in this case, the treaty, as I apprehend, removes.

The plaintiffs, Archibald and John Hamilton, trading under the firm of Archibald Hamilton & Co., were subjects of Great Britain, but were residents of North Carolina before and at the time of the Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 177G. The defendant, John Eaton, was a citizen of the United States, and of North Carolina, and was a citizen of North Carolina before the said Declaration of Independence. There were several pleas to this action. It is useless, as the case turned on that, to state any other than the first and principal one of those pleas, which was, that a law of the state had required that all persons, subjects of the state, living therein, who had traded to Great Britain or Ireland, should take an oath of allegiance or depart out of the state; that the plaintiffs had departed out of the state, leaving their debt due them; that another law of the state had appointed commissioners to sequestrate debts of citizens due to subjects of Great Britain to the use of the state, which commissioners had duly sequestrated this debt, which .the defendant had paid to them for the use of the state; and that, therefore, by the laws of war and the law of nations, the defendant did not owe this debt. To this plea it was replied, that by the treaty of peace, which was entered into between Great Britain and the United States, which terminated the war of the Revolution in 17S3, it had been stipulated by the two powers, that \u201ccreditors on either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\u201d To this replication there was a demurrer, and there was a joinder in the demurrer.\nCase No. 5,980.\nConfiscated Debts \u2014 Treaty of 17S3.\nWhen, during the war of Independence (1775 to 1783), a debt due from a citizen of North Carolina to a British subject had been confiscated to the use of that state by law of its legislature and been paid to its commissioners by the debtor, held, that under that clause of the treaty of peace of 1783, by which it had been stipulated that, citizens of either side should meet with no lawful impediment in the recovery of bona fide debts contracted before the date of the treaty, judgment must he rendered for the plaintiff in a suit brought for such debt.\n1 This report of the case is mimh condensed from a very elaborate report of fne pleadings, argument of counsel, and opinions of judge, in pages 1-77, pt. 2, Francois Xavier Martin\u2019s Notes of North Carolina Cases. 1797.\n2 [Reported by H011.

Upon your verdict the interests of four millions of your fellow-citizens may be said to depend. But whatever be the consequence, it is your duty, it is our duty, to do only what is right\n(After stating the substance of the charges against the defendant, the learned judge proceeded:)'\nIt has not been contended, on the present occasion, that the defendant has any peculiar exclusive right to take a part in the present war between the European powers, in relation to all whom the United States are in a state of peace and tranquillity. If he has no peculiar or exclusive right, it naturally follows, that what he may do every other citizen of the United States may also do. If one citizen of the United States may take part in the present war, ten thousand may. If they may take part on one side, they may take part on the other; and thus thousands of our fellow-citizens may associate themselves with different belligerent powers, destroying not only those with whom we have no hostility, but destroying each other. In such a case, can we expect peace among their friends who stay behind? And will not a civil war, with all its lamentable train of evil, be the natural effect? Yet what is right must be done, independent of the consequences, which I have only stated, in order to lay before you the necessity of seriously considering the case entrusted to you before you decide upon it\nTwo principal questions of fact have arisen, and require your determination. The first is, that the defendant, Gideon Henfield, has committed an act of hostility against the subjects of a power with whom the United States are at peace: this has been clearly established by the testimony. The second object of inquiry is, whether Gideon Hen-field was at that time a citizen of the United States. This he explicitly acknowledged to Mr. Baker; and, if he declared true, it was at that time the least of his thoughts to expatriate himself.\nThe questions of law coming into joint consideration with the facts, it is the duty of the court to explain the law to the jury, and give it to them in direction. It is the joint and unanimous opinion of the court, that the United States, being in a state of neutrality relative to the present war, the acts of hostility committed by Gideon Hen-field are an offence against this country, and punishable by its laws. It has been asked by his counsel, in their address to you, against \u25a0what law has he offended? The answer is, against many and binding laws. As a citizen of the United States, he was bound to act no part which could injure the nation; he was bound to keep the peace in regard to all nations with whom we are at peace. This is the law of nations; not an ex post facto law, but a law that was in existence long before Gideon Henfield existed. There are, also, positive laws, existing previous to the offence committed, and expressly declared to be part of the supreme law of the land. The constitution of the United States has declared that all treaties made, or to be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be part of the supreme law of the land. I will state to you, gentlemen, so much of the several treaties in force between America and any of the powers at war with France, as applies to the present case. The first article of the treaty with the United Netherlands, declares that there shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship between the States General of the United Netherlands and the United States of America, and between the subjects and inhabitants of the said parties. The seventh article of the definitive treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, declares that there shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, and between the subjects of the one and the citizens of the other. And the first article of the treaty with Prussia declares that there shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship between his Majesty the King of Prussia and his subjects, on the one part, and the United States of America and their citizens on the other. It may be observed, that the treaty would not be less sufficient in relation to the present question, if \u201csubjects\u201d and \u201ccitizens\u201d had not been mentioned. These treaties were in the most public, the most notorious existence, before the act for which the prisoner is indicted was committed. The notoriety may, indeed, be said to have been greater than that of the general acts of congress; since, besides the same mode of publication, they are expressly referred to in the constitution. Much has been said on this occasion, by the defendant\u2019s counsel, in support of the natural right of emigration; but little of it is truly applicable to the present question. Emigration is, undoubtedly, one of the natural rights of man. Yet it does not follow from thence that every act inconsistent with the duty is inconsistent with the state of a citizen. Nothing is more inconsistent with the duty of a citizen than treason; but it is because he still continues a citizen that he is liable to punishment.\n6\nAfter some other observations, explanatory of the legal principles which had been agitated in the course of the trial, the judge concluded by remarking, that the jury, in a general verdict, must decide both law and fact, but that this did not authorize them to decide it as they pleased; they were as much bound to decide by law as the judges: the responsibility was equal upon both.\nThe jury retired about nine on Saturday evening, and came into court again about half-past eleven, when they informed the court they had not agreed. They were desired to retire again, which they did, and returned on Monday morning, haying delivered into the hands of Judge WILSON a privy verdict on Sunday morning, soon after the adjournment of the court\nOne of the jurymen now expressed some doubts, which occasioned the judges separately to deliver their sentiments on the points of law adverted to in the charge on Saturday evening, each of them assenting to the same, particularly as to the change of political relation in the defendant, from his having been some time absent from home previous to his entering on board the privateer.\nThe jury again retired, and the court adjourned. At half-past four the court was convened, and the jury presented a written verdict, which the court refused to receive, as being neither general norspecial. Anotherad-journment took place, and about seven o\u2019clock a verdict of \u201cNot Guilty\u201d was delivered.\n7\n6 Prom the several charges in the text may be deduced three points:\n(1) That the participation by the citizens of a neutral state in an attack by one belligerent power upon another, is an offence against the laws of nations, and may be punished as such by such neutral state.\n(2) That though there has been no exercise of the power conferred upon congress by the constitution \u201cto define and punish offences against the laws of nations,\u201d the federal juuiciary has jurisdiction of an offence against the laws of nations, and may proceed to punish the offender according to the forms of the common law.\n(3) That a violation by a citizen of the Union of a treaty with a foreign state, may be punished in the federal courts by indictment.\nPerhaps to these may be added the much controverted position that the federal courts have common law cognizance of offences against the sovereignty of tbe United States.\nThe first point can give but little trouble. It is fully supported by the citations given by Chief Justice Jay from the civilians: and the late accomplished and lamented Mr. Wheaton, in his Commentary on the Law of Nations, lays down the same doctrine though without reference to this case. Wheat. Law Nat. 471.\nThe second and third points, however, so far as they involve the third, have been the subject of frequent discussion, and of a variety of adjudication which on a former occasion was traced as follows:\n\u201cThe inclination of authority, as has been already noticed, is, that the federal courts have no common law jurisdiction whatever in criminal cases. See 4 Tuck. Bl. App.10. In the first case in which the question was mooted \u2014 U. S. v. Ravara [Case No. 16,122] \u2014 it was argued that the offence committed was not an offence at common law, nor made so by any positive law of the United States, but it was not urged that, unless defined by statute, it could not be punished; and the court found the defendant guilty, the offence being held indictable at common law. In a case arising shortly afterwards \u2014 U. S. v. Worrall [Case No. 16,766] \u2014 Mr. Dallas, counsel for the defendant, argued that, by the 12th article of the amendment to the constitution, \u2018the powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved t.o the states respectively, or to the people.\u2019 In relation to crimes and punishments, the objects of the delegated powers of the United States, he urged, are enumerated and fixed. Every power is matter of definite and positive grant, and the very powers that are granted cannot take effect until they are exercised through the medium of the law. Congress has, undoubtedly; power to make a law which shall render it criminal to offer a bribe to the commissioner of the revenue, (the case before the court.) but not having done so, the crime is not recognized by the federal code, and consequently it is not a subject on which the judicial authority of the Union can operate. Mr. Dallas cited but three cases, which are probably all that had at that time been decided; the case of Henfield, who had been punished expressly for a violation of a treaty; that of Ravara, which he endeavour-ed to weaken; and that of Com. v. Schaffer, decided in the mayor\u2019s court of Philadelphia (4 Dal. [4 U. S.] App. 26) where it was held' that, although all powers which are essential to the independence, protection or defence of the government, ought to be considered as granted by the constitution, yet where it is found that congress has not by any act legislated on a point, and thereby divested a state of a jurisdiction which, at the time, it constitutionally possessed, such jurisdiction continues in the state courts. The court were divided in their opinions, Chas\u00e9, Circuit Judge, holding that there could be no indictment under the constitution for a common law offence, and Peters. District Judge, maintaining the contrary doctrine.\n\u201cIn the following year (1799), at a circuit court in Connecticut, the defendant was in-dieted for accepting a commission from the French Republic, and cruising against and capturing British property. No question of jurisdiction was raised, and he was convicted, it being held that he could not expatriate himself. See Williams\u2019 Case [Case No. 17,708], Shortly afterwards, Judge Washington seems to have held that there could be no indictment for perjury at common law in the courts of the United States (see Anon. [Id. 475], the report of which case appears to be defective in the conclusion of Judge Washington\u2019s opinion); and Chief Justice Marshall (U. S. v. Burr [Case No. 14,693]) hints that he too is of the opinion that no common law offence, not specified by statute, is indictable in the federal courts; and such certainly is the assumption on which he reasons in more than one succeeding case (U. S. v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. [16 U. S.] 336; U. S. v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. [18 U. S.] 76). But in a case which occurred in the circuit court of Massachusetts, \u2014 U. S. v. Coolidge [Case No. 14,857], \u2014 on an indictment for an offence committed on the high seas, the question arose, directly, whether the circuit court had jurisdiction to punish offences against the United States, which had not been defined, and to which no punishment had been affixed. The judge, admitting that the courts of the United States were of limited jurisdiction, and could exercise no authority not expressly granted to them, contended, that when an authority was once lawfully given, the nature and extent of that authority, and the mode in which it should be exercised, must be regulated by the rules of the common law, and that, if this distinction was made, it would dissipate the whole difficulty and obscurity of the subject. Congress, he said, might, under the constitution, confide to the circuit courts jurisdiction of all offences against the United States, and they had conferred on them jurisdiction of almost all; that by the judiciary act the circuit courts have exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the- United States, except where that or another statute of the United States otherwise provides: that, in order to ascertain what are crimes and offences against the United States, recourse must be had to the common law, taken in connection with the constitution; and that congress has provided for the punishment of many crimes which it has not defined, an explanation and definition of which can only be found in the common law. The inference, he urged, was plain, that the circuit courts have cognizance of all offences against the United States; that what these offences were depended upon the common law, applied to the powers confided to the United States: that the circuit courts, having such cognizance, might punish by fine and imprisonment where no punishment was specially provided by statute; that the admiralty was a court of extensive criminal, as well as civil, jurisdiction; and that offences of admiralty were exclusively cognizable by the United States, and punishable by fine and imprisonment, where no other punishment was specially prescribed. The district judge dissenting, the case came before the supreme court of the United States; and it is evident, from the reported case, \u2014 [U. S. v. Coolidge] 1 Wheat. [14 U. S.] 415, \u2014 that a strong desire existed in the minds of the judges to hear the whole question of the extent of jurisdiction re-argued. The attorney general, however, declining to do so, being unwilling to attempt to shake U. S. v. Hudson, 7 Crunch [11 U. S.] 32, by the authority of that case the court felt themselves bound, and so certified to the circuit court Chancellor Kent does not seem to think that the case of U. S. v. Coolidge [supra] should be governed by the same principle as those of U. S. v. Hudson and U. S. v. Worrall [supra], the one a libel and the other an attempt to bribe a commissioner of the revenue, the two latter being decided on the ground that the constitution had given to the courts no jurisdiction in such cases; whereas, the Case of Coolidge was one of admiralty, over which the federal courts seem to have a general and exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d Kent, Comm. p. 338: Whart. Cr. Law, p. 40. See, also, Rawle, Const. 258: Serg. Const. 272.\nBut even assuming that the doctrine that the common law, as a source of jurisdiction, does not control the federal courts, is now finally established, it by no means follows that the common law, as a rule for the exercise of a jurisdiction previously given, does not apply undiminished except so far as it interferes with positive statute. Thus it may be argued, that, as congress has power to \u201cdefine and punish offences against the law of nations,\u201d the jurisdiction of the states is thereby uivested of the particular subject matter; and that consequently as the jurisdiction exists somewhere, it exists in the federal courts, ready to oe exercised through the statutory medium, when congress specifies the procedure, but when no legislation has taken place, through the agency of the common law. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch [5 U. S.] 137. tends to the doctrine that the federal jurisdiction in this and kindred cases is exclusive; and such is the express ruling of Com. v. Kosloff, 5 Serg. & R. 545. where Chief Justice Tilghman refused to take cognizance of a suit respecting a consul. The pregnant inquiry pressed home in the latter case: \u2014 \u201cT- the constitution to be so construed as to exclude the jurisdiction of all inferior courts, and yet suffer the authority of the supreme court to be dormant until called into action by law,\u201d &c., gives no obscure intimation of the leaning of tfiat wise and clear headed judge on this very point. It is not inconsistent, therefore, with the doctrine-discarding the common law as an origin of jurisdiction to the federal courts, to hold that where an express subject matter is ceded to the federal government by the constitution, that subject matter is to be acted upon through the medium of common law forms. This distinction is dwelt upon by the late Mr. Duponceau in his notice of this very case.\n\u201cJudge Wilson, who presided at this trial, in his charge to the jury, took the ground of.its being also an offence at common law, of which the law of nations was a part, and maintained the doctrine that the common law was to be looked to for the definition and punishment of the offence. This, ground had not been adverted to in argument, or, at least, very slightly. But it would seem that the common law considered as a municipal system had nothing to do with this case. The law of nations, being the common law of the civilized world, may be said, indeed, to be a part of the law of every civilized nation; but it stands on other and higher grounds than municipal customs, statutes, edicts, or ordinances. It is binding on every people and on every government. It is to be carried into effect at all times under the penalty pf being thrown out of the pale of civilization, or involving the country into a war. Every branch of the national administration, each within its district and its particular jurisdiction, is bound to administer it. It defines offences and affixes punishments, and acts everywhere proprio rigore, whenever it is not altered or modified by particular national statutes, or usages not inconsistent with its great and fundamental principles. Whether there is or not a national common law in other respects this universal common law can never cease to be the rule of executive and judicial proceedings until mankind shall return to the savage state. Judge Wilson, therefore, in my opinion, rather weakened than strengthened the ground of the prosecution in placing the law of nations on the same footing with the municipal or local common law and deriving its authority exclusively from the latter. It was considering the subject in its narrowest point of view.\u2019\u2019 Dup. Jur. 3. A distinction of a parallel character is taken by Mr. Dallas, in his speech in Worrall\u2019s Case [supra], which will be presently given, where he argues that in the case in the text the defendant was indicted for an infraction of a treaty, which is the supreme law of the land, and that consequently that case is no authority for the position that at common law alone any offence against the sovereignty of the United States is indictable.\nThere are, however, great difficulties in the way of giving the federal courts criminal jurisdictions over inf ractions of treaties, or of the law of nations, and at the same time refusing them such jurisdiction over common law offences. If the common law is inadmissible to execute the jurisdiction in the latter case, the question is a critical one, whether the former can be taken in to help out the jurisdiction of the latter; and .such, in fact, appears to have been the view of Judge Wilson, who, declining to place the case on the narrow ground of the law of nations alone, declared the offence to be cognizable at common law. Supposing, therefore, that Henfieia\u2019s Case is in such direct conflict with U. S. v. Coolidge, and U. S. v. Hudson [supra], that either the former or the two latter must fall, the question arises, which is to be considered as law?\nHenfield\u2019s Case, it is true, was not reviewed by the court in banc, but the ruling of the court at the trial was made after a full and ample discussion by counsel distinguished for their learning and sagacity, and received the assent both of Judge Peters, the district judge, and of all the judges of the supreme court but one. Chief Justice Jay, to whom as a constitutional lawyer, no one can be pronounced superior, and to whom of all the judges who ever sat on that bench the character of a cotemporaneous expositor most properly belongs, announces the jurisdiction in advance with great solemnity, in a charge which exhibits grave deliberation. Judge Wilson and Judge Iredell, both of whom sat in the constitutional convention, proclaimed the same doctrine at the trial. The prosecution was instituted by Mr. Edmund Randolph, certainly not one of that class which leaned to an enlarged view of the judicial power, and his official opinion as attorney general was given beforehand that the offence was one which the federal courts have power to punish. Mr. Jefferson. almost at the same moment, in substance directs Mr. Morris to explain to the British court that the acquittal arose not from a want of power to punish, but a doubt in the minds of the jury as to the guilty intent; (see next note) and Chief Justice Marshall many years afterwards, laments over the verdict of the jury, not as the necessary result of a lack of jurisdiction but as a melancholy exhibition of party zeal. Id. By none of these is there the least intimation of a doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court; and when the character of the men themselves is recollected \u2014 the sound, wary, experienced judgment of Chief Justice Jay \u2014 the singular sagacity of Mr. Jefferson in every branch of our system, and his peculiar sensitiveness to judicial encroachments \u2014 and the excellent capacity and long experience of Judge Iredell, Judge Wilson, and Judge Peters \u2014 it cannot now be said that the jurisdiction was assumed inconsiderately or acquiesced in blindly. It undoubtedly was exercised because the united opinion of the day required its exercise. It was exercised in conformity with the opinion announced by Washington in liis proclamation of neutrality \u2014 a paper unanimously adopted by the cabinet, as a correct exposition to foreign states of the power of the federal government\u2014 that the federal government in such cases could through its courts punish the offender. 10 Wash. Writ, by Sparks. 535, ante, p. 53. How far this opinion is to be considered as shaken in U. S. v. Hudson, where the proceedings were ex parte, and U. S. v. Coolidge, where the attorney general abandoned the question, is yet to be determined.\n7 Chief Justice Marshall (Life of Washington, vol. 2. pp. 273, 274) thuB notices the result: \u201cThe administration received additional evidence of the difficulty that would attend an adherence to the system which had been commenced in the acquittal of Gideon Henfield. A prosecution had been instituted against this person, who had enlisted in Charleston on board a French privateer equipped in that port, which had brought her prizes into the port of Philadelphia. This prosecution had been directed under the advice of the attorney general, who was of opinion that persons of this description were punishable for having violated subsisting treaties, which by the constitution are the supreme law of the land, and that they were also indictable at common law, for disturbing the neace of the United States. It could not be expected that the Democratic party would be inattentive to an act so susceptible of misrepresentation. Their papers sounded the alarm, and it was universally asked, \u2018What law had been offended, and under what statute was the indictment supported? Were the American people already prepared to give to a proclamation the force of a legislative act, and to subject themselves to the will of the executive? But if they were already sunk to such a state of degradation, were they to be punished for violating a proclamation which had not been published when the offence was committed, if indeed it could be termed an offence to engage with Prance, combating for liberty against the combined despots of Europe.\u2019 \u201d \u201cAs the trial approached, a great degree of sensibility was displayed, and the verdict in favour of Henfield was celebrated with extravagant marks of joy and exultation. It bereaved the executive of the strength to be derived from an opinion, that punishment might be legally inflicted on those who should openly violate the rules prescribed for the preservation of neutrality; and exposed that department to the obloquy of having attempted a measure which the laws would not justify.\u201d The verdict was considered by Washington of such moment, as to lead him to enumerate it as a principal reason to be considered in the question of calling an extra session of congress, respecting which he asked the opinion of his cabinet on August 3, 1793. See 10 Wash. Writ, by Sparks. 362.\nIn a letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Morris. then in England (3 Jeff. Cor. 271), it is said: \"It has been pretended, indeed, that the engagement of a citizen in an enterprise of this nature, was a divestment of the character of citizen, and a transfer of jurisdiction over him to another sovereign. Our citizens are entirely free to divest themselves of that character by emigration, and other acts manifesting their intention, and may then become the subjects of another power, and free to do whatever the subjects of that power may do. But the laws do not admit that the bare commission of a crime amounts of itself to a divestment of the character of citizen, and withdraws the criminal from their coercion. They would never prescribe an illegal act among the legal modes by which a citizen must disfranchise himself; nor render treason, for instance, innocent.'by giving it the force of a dissolution of the obligation of the criminal to his country. Accordingly, in the case of Henfield, a citizen of these states, charged with having engaged, in tlm port of Charleston, in an enterprise against nations at peace with us, and having joined in the actual commission of hostilities, the attorney general of the. United States, in an official opinion, declared that the act with which he was charged was punishable by law. The same thing has been unanimously declared by two of the circuit courts of the United States, as you will see in the charges of Chief Justice Jay, delivered at Richmond, and Judge Wilson, delivered at Philadelphia: both of which are herewith sent. Yet Mr. Genet, in the moment he lands at Charleston, is able to tell the governor, and continues to affirm in his correspondence there, that no law of the United States authorizes their government to restrain either its own citizens or the foreigners inhabiting its territory, from warring against the enemies of France. It is true, indeed, that in the Case of Henfield, the jury which tried, absolved him. But it appeared on the trial, that the crime was not knowingly and wilfully committed; that Hen-field was ignorant of the unlawfulness of his undertaking; that, in the moment he was apprized of it he showed real contrition; that he had rendered meritorious services during the late war. and declared that he would live and die an American. The jury, therefore, in absolving him, did no more than the constitutional authority might have done, had they found him guilty; the constitution having provided for the pardon of certain offences in certain cases, and there being no case where it could have been more proper than where no offence was contemplated. Henfield. therefore, was still an American citizen, and Mr. Genet\u2019s reclamation of him was as unauthorized as the first enlistment of him.\u201d See, generally, Wait, St. Pap. 85, 86. 143.\nMr. Genet\u2019s proceedings during the trial were marked with his usual turbulence. Starting with the inception of the prosecution, he addresses the secretary of state as follows: \u201cI have this moment been informed that two officers in the service of the Republic of France, citizens Gideon Henfield and John Singletary, have been arrested on board the privateer of the French Republic, the-Citizen Genet, and conducted to prison. The crime, laid to their charge \u2014 the crime which my mind cannot conceive, and which my pen almost refuses to state \u2014is the serving of France, and defending with her children the common glorious cause of liberty. Being ignorant. of any positive law which deprives Americans of this privilege, and authorizes officers of police arbitrarily to take mariners in the service of France from on board their vessels, I call upon your intervention, sir, and that of the president of the United States, in order to obtain the immediate releasement of the above mentioned officers, who have acquired by the sentiments animating them, and by the act of their engagement, anterior to every act to the contrary, the right of French citizens if they have lost that of American citizens.\u201d Keeping even pace with the prosecution, at every fresh step taken by it he sends in a fresh protest; and immediately on the rendition of the verdict, issues cards to a dinner part--- \u201cto meet Citizen Henfield;\u201d following up th5= last stroke by announcing that \u201cthe citizen\u201d had been formally taken under the protection of the French Republic. Unfortunately, however, for Henfield, this \u201cprotection\u201d was not very potent, for, elated with the honour of French citizenship, he sallied forth in a new excursion, which resulted in his capture by a British cruiser.", "author": "Judge WILSON", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Circuit Court, D. Pennsylvania.\nHENFIELD\u2019S CASE.\n1793.\nA charge delivered by the Honourable JOHN JAX, Esquire, Chief Justice of the United States, to the grand jury impannelled for the court of the United States, holden for the Middle circuit in the district of Virginia, at the cap\u00edtol in the city of Richmond, on the 22d day of May, 1793.\n1\nGentlemen of the Grand Jury: That citizens and nations should [so] use their own as not to injure others, is an ancient and excellent maxim; and is one of those plain precepts of common justice, which it is the interest of all, and the duty of each to obey, and that not only in the use they may make of their property, but also of their liberty, their power and other blessings of every kind.\nTo restrain men from violating the rights of society and of one another; and impartially to give security and protection to all, are among the most important objects of a free government. I say a free government, because in those that are not free, these objects being in certain .respects secondary to others are less regarded, and less perfectly provided for. Where the conduct of the citizens is regulated by the laws made by themselves and for their common benefit, and executed by men deriving authority from, and responsible to them, the most regular and exact obedience to those laws is to be expected, required and rendered. By their constitution and laws, the people of the United States have expressed their will, and their will so expressed, must sway and rule supreme in our republic. It is in obedience to their will, and in pursuance of their authority, that this court is now to dispense their justice in this district; and they have made it your duty, gentlemen, to inquire whether any and what infractions of their laws have been committed in this district, or on the seas, by persons in or belonging to it Proceed, therefore, to inquire accordingly, and to present such as either have, or shall come to your knowledge. That you may perceive more clearly the extent and objects of your inquiries, it may be proper to observe, that the laws .of the United States admit of being classed under three heads of descriptions. 1st. All treaties made under the authority of the United States. 2d. The laws of nations. 3dly. The constitution, and statutes of the United States.\nTreaties between independent nations, are contracts or bargains which derive all their force and obligation from mutual consent and agreement; and consequently, when once fairly made and properly concluded, cannot be altered or annulled by one of the parties, without the consent and concurrence of the other. Wide is the difference between treaties and statutes \u2014 we may negotiate and make contracts with other nations, but we can neither legislate for them, nor they for us; we may repeal or alter our statutes, but no nation can have authority to vacate or modify treaties at discretion. Treaties, therefore, necessarily become the supreme law of the land, and so they are-very properly de-dared to be by the sixth article of the constitution. Whenever doubts and questions' arise relative to the validity, operation or construction of treaties, or of any articles in \u25a0them, those doubts and questions must be settled according to the maxims and principles of the laws of nations applicable to the case. The peace, prosperity, and reputation of the United States, will always greatly depend on their fidelity to their engagements; and every virtuous citizen (for every citizen is a party to them) will concur in observing- and executing them with honour and good faith; and that, whether they be made with nations respectable and important, or with nations weak and inconsiderable, our obligation to keep our faith results from our having pledged it, and not from the character or description of the state or people, to whom, neither impunity nor the right of re- \u2022 taliation can sanctify perfidy; for although perfidy may deserve chastisement, yet it can never merit imitation.\n2. As to the laws of nations \u2014 they are those laws by which nations are bonnd to regulate their conduct towards each other, both in peace and war. Providence has been pleased to place the United States among the nations of the earth, and therefore, all those \u25a0duties, as well as rights, which spring from the relation of nation to nation, have devolved upon us. We are with other nations, tenants in common of the sea \u2014 it is a highway for all, and all are bound to exercise that common right, and use that common highway in the manner which the laws of nations and treaties require. On this occasion, it is proper to observe to you, gentlemen, that various circumstances and considerations now unite in urging the people of .the United States to be particularly exact and circumspect in observing the obligation .of treaties, an,d the laws of nations, which, .as has been already remarked, form a very important part of the laws of our nation. I allude to the facts and injunctions speci-iied in the president\u2019s late proclamation; it is in these words: \u201cWhereas, it appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prus\u25a0sia, Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands of the one part, and Prance of \u2022the other, and the duty and interest of the United States, require that they should with. sincerity and good faith, adopt and pursue a* conduct friendly and impartial towards the \u2019belligerent powers: I have, therefore, thought fit by these presents, to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the .conduct aforesaid towards these powers respectively, and to exhort and warn the citi\u2022zens of the United States, carefully to avoid .all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner tend to contravene such \u25a0disposition. I do hereby make known, that whosoever of the citizens of the United \u2022States, shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture, under the law of nations, by committing, aiding, or abetting hostilities against any of the said powers, or \u2022by carrying to them those articles which nre deemed contraband, by the modern usage \u25a0 \u2022of nations, will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment .or forfeiture; and further, that I have given instructions to those officers to whom it be \u2022 longs, to cause prosecutions to be instituted .\u2022against all persons who shall within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, \u25a0violate the law of nations, with respect to the powers at war, or any of them.\u201d\nBy this proclamation, authentic and official information is given to the citizens of the United States: \u2014 That war actually exists between the nations mentioned in it: That they are to observe a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers: That offenders will not be protected, but on the contrary, prosecuted and punished. The law .of nations, considers those as neutral nations \u201cwho take no part in the war, remaining friends to both parties, and not favouring the arms of one to the detriment of the other;\u201d and it declares that a \u201cnation, desirous safely to enjoy the conveniences of neutrality, is in all things to show an exact impartiality between the parties at war; for should he, when under no obligation, favour one to the detriment of the other, he cannot complain of being treated as an adherent and confederate of his enemy,' of which no nation would be the dupe if able to resent it\u201d The proclamation is exactly consistent with and declaratory of the conduct enjoined by the law of nations. It is worthy of remark that we are at peace with all these belligerent powers not only negatively in having war with none of them, but also in a more positive and particular sense by treaties with four of them.\nBy the first article of our treaty with France it is stipulated that \u201cthere shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace, and true and sincere friendship between his Host Christian Majesty, his heirs and successors, and the United States; and between the countries, islands, cities and towns situate under the jurisdiction of his Most Christian Majesty and of the United States, and the people and inhabitants of every degree, without exception of persons or places.\u201d By the first article of our treaty with the United Netherlands, it is stipulated that \u201cthere shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace, and sincere friendship between their High Might-inesses, the Lords and States General of the United Netherlands and the United States of America, and between the subjects and inhabitants of the said parties, and between the countries, islands and-places situate under the jurisdiction of the said United Netherlands and the United States of America, their subjects and inhabitants of every degree, without exception of persons or places.\u201d The definitive treaty of peace with Great Britain begins with great solemnity, in the words following: \u201cIn the name of the most holy and undivided Trinity.\u201d By the seventh article of this treaty it is stipulated that \u201cthere shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, and between the subjects of the one and the citizens of the other.\u201d By the first article of our treaty with Prussia it is stipulated that \u201cthere shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace and sincere friendship between his Majesty, the King of Prussia, his heirs, successors and subjects on the one part, and the United States of America and their citizens on the other, without exception of persons or places.\u201d\nBy the laws of. nations, the United States, as a neutral power, are bound to observe the line of conduct indicated by the proclamation towards all the belligerent powers, and that although we may have no treaties with them. But with respect to France, the United Netherlands, Great Britain and Prussia, the before-mentioned articles in our treaties with them, create additional obligations, to wit: all those obligations which result from express compact and from national faith, mutually, explicitly and solemnly pledged. Surely no engagements can be more wise and virtuous than those whose direct object is to maintain peace and to preserve large portions of the human race from the complicated evils incident to war. While the people of other nations do no violence or injustice to \u25a0our citizens, it would certainly be criminal and wicked in our citizens, for the sake of plunder, To do violence and injustice t\u00f3 any of them. The president, therefore, has with great propriety declared \u201cthat the duty and interest of the United States require that they should, with sincerity and' good faith, adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial towards the belligerent powers.\u201d A celebrated writer on the law of nations very Justly observes that \u201cas nature has given to man the right of using force only when it becomes necessary for their- defence, and the preservation of their rights, the inference is manifest that since the establishment of political societies, a right- so dangerous in its exercise no longer remains with private persons, except in those kind of rencontres, where society cannot protect or defend them. In the bosom of society, public authority decides aill differences of the citiz'ens, represses violence and checks the impulse of revenge. It woud be too dangerous to give every citizen the liberty of doing himself justice against foreigners, as every individual of a nation might involve it in a war, and how could peace be preserved between nations if it was in the power of every man to disturb it? A right of so great moment, the right of judging.whether a\u2018nation has a real cause of complaint, whether its case allows of using force, and having recourse to arms; whether prudence admits, and whether the welfare of the state demands it; this right,\u201d he says, \u201ccan only belong to the body of the nation, or to the sovereign its representative. It is doubtless one of those without which there can be no salutary government\u201d It is on these and similar principles that whoever shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture, un\u2022der the law of nations, by committing, aiding or abetting hostilities forbidden by his country, ought to lose the protection of his country against such punishment or forfeiture. But this is not all, it is not sufficient that a nation should only withdraw its protection from such offenders, it ought also to prosecute and punish them. The same writer very justly remarks that \u201cthe nation or sovereign ought not to suffer the citizens to do any injury to the subjects of another state, much less to offend the state itself; and that \u25a0not only because no sovereign ought to permit those who are under his command -to violate the precepts of the law of nature which forbids all injuries, but also because nations ought to respect each other, to abstain from all abuse, from all injury, and, in a word, from everything that may be of prejudice to others. If a sovereign who might keep his subjects within the rules of justice and peace, suffers them to injure a foreign nation, either in its body or its members, he does no less injury to that nation than .if he injured them himself. In short, the safety of the state and that of human society require this attention from every sovereign. If you let loose the reins of your subjects against foreign nations, these will behave in the same manner to you, and instead of that friendly intercourse which nature has established between all men we should see nothing but one nation robbing another.\u201d The respect which every nation owes to itself imposes a duty on its government to cause all its laws to be respected and obeyed, and that not only by its proper citizens, but also by those strangers who may visit and occasionally reside within its territories. There is no principle better established than that all strangers admitted into a country, are, during their residence, subject to the laws of it; and if they violate the laws they are to be punished according to the laws; the design of pains and penalties being to render the laws respected and to maintain order and safety. Hence, it follows that the subjects of belligerent powers are bound, while in this country, to respect the neutrality of it, and are punishable in common with our own citizens for violations of it, within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States. It is to be remembered, that every nation is, and ought to be, perfectly and absolutely sovereign within its own dominions, to the entire exclusion \u2014 of- all foreign power, interference and jurisdiction, whether attempted by a foreign prince, or by his subjects, with or without his order. \u201cIt is a manifest consequence of the liberty and independence of nations, that -all of them have a right to.be governed as they think proper, and that none have the least authority to interfere in the government of another state. Of all the rights that can belong to a nation, sovereignty is doubtless the most precious, and that which others ought the most scrupulously to respect, if they would not do it an injury.\u201d These are general principles \u2014 the laws to which they apply are numerous, and need not be particularized in detail \u2014 on the present occasion, it will be sufficient to lead your attention to one or two, which will serve to explain the reason and extent of these principles. \u201cThe right of levying soldiers is a sovereign right belonging only'to the nation. No foreign power can lawfully exercise it without .permission, nor without previous permission can such attempts be otherwise regarded, than as improper interferences with the sovereignty of the country; on this head the law of nations is explicit. It declares, That the right of levying soldiers belongs solely to the nation: this important power is the appendage of the sovereign; it makes a part of the supreme prerogative. No person is to enlist soldiers in a foreign country without the permission of the sovereign. They who undertake to enlist soldiers in a foreign country, without the sovereign\u2019s permission, or alienate the subjects of another, violate one, of the most sacred rights both of the prince and the state; it is a crime punished with great severity in every policied state. Foreign recruiters are hanged immediately, and very justly, as it is not to be presumed, that their sovereign ordered them to commit the crime; and if he did, they ought not to have obeyed his order, their sovereign having no right to command what is contrary to the law of nature; usually they who have practised seduction only are severely punished. But if it appears that they acted by order of the sovereign, such a proceeding in a foreign sovereign is justly considered as an injury, and as a sufficient cause for declaring war against him, unless he condescends to make suitable reparation.\u201d\nFrom the observations which have been made, this conclusion appears to result, viz.: That the United States are in a state of neutrality relative to all the powers at war, and that it is their duty, their interest, and their disposition to maintain it: that, therefore, they who commit, aid, or abet hostilities against these powers, or either of them, offend against the laws of the United States, and ought to be punished; and consequently, that it is your duty, gentlemen, to inquire into and present all such of these offences, as you shall find to have been \u25a0 committed within this district What acts amount to committing or aiding, or abetting hostilities, must be determined by the laws and approved practice of nations, and by the treaties and other laws of the United States relative to such cases. I doubt the expediency of anticipating such cases, and endeavouring now to distinguish acts which do, from others which do not, involve the criminality in question. Singular cases may arise. \u2014 If, in the course of your inquiries, you should experience difficulties, the attorney general and, if necessary, the court, will assist you.\nBefore I dismiss this subject, it cannot be improper to remark, that a .state of neutrality leaves us perfectly at liberty to exercise every humane, benevolent, and friendly office towards the powers at war and their subjects; and to continue our usual commerce with them, excepting only those offices and that kind of trade, which may be designed and calculated to give to one party a military preponderancy to the detriment of the others. While we contemplate with anxiety and regret the desolation and distress which a war so general and so inflamed will probably spread over more than one country, let us with becoming gratitude, wisely estimate and cherish the peace, liberty, and safety with which the Divine Providence has been pleased so liberally to bless us. By the favour of Heaven, we this day enjoy a degree of prosperity unknown to any other nation in the world\u2014 let it be among our enjoyments to- render our happiness instrumental in alleviating the misfortunes to which many have already been, and more will yet be, reduced by those national contentions \u2014 in a word-let us be faithful to all \u2014 kind to all \u2014 but let us also be just to ourselves.\nThe people of the United States have exhibited too many proofs of virtue and intelligence, to leave room to doubt their continuing to be so guided by their usual integrity and good sense \u2014 but in every nation individuals will always be found who, impelled by avarice or ambition, or by both, will not hesitate to gratify those passions at the expense of the blood and tears even of those who are free from blame. Such men are to be restrained only by fear of punishment. There is, however, another consideration connected with the subject which merits much attention. It is natural in all contests, even for the best men, to take sides, and wish success to one party in preference to the other; our wishes and partialities becoming Inflamed by opposition, often cause indiscretions, and lead us to say and to do things that had better have been omitted. It is not certain that the irritability of the belligerent powers, combined with some indiscretions on our part, will not involve us in war with some of them. Prudence directs us to look forward to such an event, and to endeavour not only to avert, but also to be prepared for it. Among our preparations, there can be none more important than union and harmony among ourselves. It is very desirable, that such an event do not find us divided into parties, and particularly into parties in favour of either foreign nation. Should this be the case, our situation would be dangerous as well as disgraceful. While blessed with union in sentiments and measures relative to national objects, we shall have little fear; and, therefore, it is sincerely to be wished that on* citizens will cheerfully and punctually do their duty to every other nation, but at the same time carefully avoid becoming partisans of any of them. There is not a history of any nation which does not record the mischiefs they experienced from such parties, and they rarely present us with an instance of a nation being conquered and subjugated, without the detestable aid of its own degenerate or deluded citizens. Nothing is more certain than, that if such parties should arise among the people, they will find their way into every department of government, and carry distrust and discord with them \u2014 dark and dreary would then be the prospect before us, and we should in vain look for the speedy return of those happy days, when the government was peacefully, wisely and prosperously administered, under the care and auspices of a patriot, in whom the United States have by repeated unanimity. In their suffrages, manifested a degree of confidence, no less reputable to their own wisdom and virtue than to his. But, if neither integrity nor prudence on our part should prove sufficient to shield us from war, we may then meet it with fortitude, and a \u25a0firm dependence on the Divine-protection; whenever it shall become impossible to preserve peace by avoiding offences, it will be our duty to refuse to purchase it by sacrifices and humiliations, unworthy of a free and magnanimous people, either to demand or submit to. The subject presented by the proclamation, appeared to me to be highly interesting, and I thought it useful to treat it with much plainness, as well as latitude. I was aware that I was treading on delicate ground; but as the path of my duty led over it, it was incumbent on me to proceed.\nOn the third branch of the laws of the United States, viz: their constitution and statutes, 1 shall be concise. Here, also, one great unerring principle, viz: the will of the people, will \u25a0 take the lead. The people of the United States, being by the grace and favour of Heaven, free, sovereign and independent, had a right to choose the form of national government which they should judge most conducive to their happiness and safety. They have done so, and have ordained and established the one which is specified in their great and general compact ' or constitution \u2014 a compact deliberately formed, maturely considered, and solemnly adopted and ratified by them. There is not a word in it but what is employed to express tlie will of the people; and what friend of his country, and the liberties of it, will say that the will of the people is not to be observed, respected and obeyed? To this general compact every citizen is a party, and consequently, every citizen is bound by it. To oppose the operation of this constitution and of the government established by it, would be to violate the sovereignty of the people, and would justly merit reprehension and punishment. The statutes of the United States, constitutionally made, derive their obligation from the same source, and must bind accordingly. Happy would it be for mankind,-and greatly would it promote the cause of liberty and the equal rights of men, if the free and popular government which from time to time may result, should be so constructed, so balanced, so organized and administered, as to be evidently and eminently productive of a higher and more durable degree of happiness than any of the other forms. It is not sufficient to tell men by a bill of rights, that they are free, that they have equal rights, and that they are entitled to be protected in them; men will not believe they are really free, while they experience oppression \u2014 the3r do not think their title to equal rights realized until they enjoy them; nor will they esteem that a good government, whatever may be its name, which does not uniformly, impartially and effectually protect them. The more free the people are, the more strong and efficient ought their government to be, and for this plain reason, that it is a more arduous task to make and keep up the fences of law and justice about twenty rights than about five or six; and because it is more difficult to fence against and restrain men who are unfettered, than men who are in yokes and chains. Being a free people, we are governed only by laws, and those of our own making \u2014 these laws are rules for regulating the conduct of individuals, and are established according to, and in pursuance of that' contract which each citizen has made with the rest, and all - with each. He is not a good citizen who violates his contract with society; and when society execute their laws, they do no more than what is necessary to constrain individuals to perform that contract, on the due operation and observance of which the common good and welfare of the community depend; for the object of it is to secure to every man what belongs to him, as a member of the nation; and by increasing the common stock of property, to augment the value of his share in it Most essentially, therefore, is it the duty and interest of us all, that the laws be observed, and irresistibly executed. I might now proceed to call your attention to certain statutes which merit particular attention, and it would not be difficult to place them in points of view, in which their importance to the public would appear in strong lights\u2014 but having already detained you so long, and these subjects not being new to you, I will forbear enlarging on them on the present occasion. The manner in which you are to fulfil the duties now incumbent on you, is specified in the oath you have taken. The experience of ages commends the institution of grand juries; it has merited and received constant encomiums, and I trust, gentlemen, that your conduct on this and similar occasions, will afford new proofs of its utility and excellence.\n2\nCharge of Judge \"WILSON, as \u25a0 president of a special court of the United States, for the Middle circuit and Pennsylvania district, holden at the court house, in the city of Philadelphia, on the 22d day of July, 1793, to the grand jury of said court:\nGentlemen of the Grand Jury: It is my duty to explain to you the very important occasion on which this court is specially convened, and to state the points of law not less important to the application of which that occasion gives rise.\nTo the judge of the Pennsylvania district information was given on oath, that certain citizens o\u00ed the- Unites States had acted !n: several capacities as officers on board an armed schooner, said to be commissioned by France as a cruiser or private ship-of-war; and with others on board that schooner did capture and make prize of several ships or vessels belonging to his Britannic Majesty, and otherwise assist in an hostile manner in annoying the commerce of the subjects of his said Britannic Majesty, who is at peace with the United States, contrary to their duty as citizens of the United States. On receiving this information the judge issued his warrant for apprehending the persons against whom complaint was made, that they might answer for their doings in the premises, and be dealt with according to law. That legal proceedings in this and some other business might be had speedily, one of the judges of the supreme court of the United States and the judge of the Pennsylvania district issued their warrant, directing that on this day, and at this place a special session of the circuit court for this district should be held, and that grand and traverse jurors should be summoned to attend it. As the court however is authorized generally to try criminal causes, if any other crimes or offences cognizable in it be laid before you or are in your knowledge, it is your duty to present them. But to the business to which you have been particularly called, and to articles intimately connected with it, I shall confine the remarks which I have to give you in charge. I introduce them by noticing, with pleasure, the near and endearing relation between the freedom and the dignity of man. In governments unfavourable to both, treaties and the construction of treaties are numbered among the arcana imperil, the secrets of empire, enclosed within the cabinets of princes and secluded from the judgment of the citizens, whose lives and fortunes however they chiefly affect; under our national constitution, treaties compose a portion of the public and supreme law of the land, and for their construction and enforcement are brought openly before the tribunals of our country. Of those tribunals juries form an essential part; under the construction given by those juries, treaties will suffer neither in their importance nor in their sanctity.\n\u201cSapientissima res tempus\u201d \u2014 says the profound Bacon in one of his aphorisms, concerning the augmentation of the sciences\u2014 time is the wisest of things. If the qualities \u25a0of the parent may be expected in the offspring, the common law, one of the noblest births of time, may be pronounced the wisest of laws. This expression, says a great lawyer (Finch, Law, 74, 75), is not new and strange, or barbarous and peculiar to England. It is the proper term for other laws also. Euripides mentions the common laws of Greece; and Plato defines common law to be that, which being taken up by the common consent of a country, is called law. In another place the same illustrious philosopher names it the golden and sacred rule of reason which we call \u201cCommon Law.\u201d To the common law of England, however, the phrase is often peculiarly appropriated. Of this common law, the antiquity is unquestionably very high. But the precise era of its commencement, and the several springs from which it originally flowed, it is very difficult, if not altogether impracticable to trace. One reason for this may be drawn from the very nature of a system of common law. As it is accommodated to the situation and circumstances of the people; and as that situation and those circumstances insensibly change, a proportioned variation of laws insensibly takes place; and it becomes impossible to ascertain ihe period when this change began, or to mark the different steps of its progress.\nIt might be amusing and instructive, but at this time it would be improper, to sketch the general outlines of the system through the government of the Saxons down to the conquest of the Normans. Suffice it to observe, and the observation is important, that the common law, as now received in America, bears, in its principles and in many of its more minute particulars, a stronger and a fairer resemblance to the common law as it was improved under the former, than to that law as it was disfigured under the latter. The accommodating principle of a system of common law will adjust its improvement to every grade and species of improvement (Fortes, 257, 264), in consequence of practice, commerce, observation, study or refinement. As the science of legislation is the most noble, so it is the most slow and difficult of sciences. Willing to avail itself of experience, it receives additional improvement from every new situation to which it arrives; and in this manner attains, in .the progress of time, higher and higher degrees of perfection, resulting from the accumulated wisdom of ages. On some occasions the spirit of a system of common law is accommodating; but on others its temper is decided and firm. The means are varied according to times and circumstances, but its great ends are kept steadily and constantly in view. How effectually has the spirit of liberty animated this system in all the vicissitudes, revolutions and dangers to which it has been exposed! In matters of a civil nature the common law works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of justice. In matters of a political nature it works itself pure by rules drawn from the fountain of freedom. It was this spirit which dictated the frequent and formidable demands on the Norman princes, for the complete restoration of the Saxon jurisprudence. It was this spirit which, in Magna Charta, manifested a strict regard to the rights of the Commons as well as those of the Peers. It was this spirit which ex\u2022tracted sweetness from all the bitter contentions between the rival houses of York and Lancaster. It was this spirit which preserved England from the haughtiness of the Tudors and from the tyranny of the Stuarts. It was this spirit which rescued the states \u2022of America from the oppressive claims and from all the mighty efforts made to enforce the \u2022 oppressive claims of a British parliament The common law, says my Lord Coke \u2022(Calvin\u2019s Case, 7 Coke, 1), is a social system \u2022of jurisprudence. She receives other laws and systems into a friendly correspondence; and associates to herself those who can give her information, or advice, or assistance. Does a contract bear a peculiar reference to the local laws of any particular foreign country? By the local laws of that foreign country the common law will direct the contract to be interpreted and adjusted. Does a mercantile question occur? She \u25a0determines it by the law of merchants. Does a question arise before her, which properly ought to be resolved by the law of nations? By that law .she will decide the question. For that law in its full extent is \u25a0.adopted by her. The infractions of that law form a part of her code of criminal jurisprudence. 4 Bl. Comm. 67.\nIn our present business, gentlemen, this great subject deserves a full and a pointed illustration. Such as it is in my power, on a short notice, to give, I now proceed to lay before you. The law of nature when applied to states or political societies, receives a new name, that of the law of nations. But though it receives a new appellation, it retains unimpaired its qualities and its powers. The law of nations as well as the law \u2022of nature, is of obligation indispensable. The law of nations as well as the law of nature is of \u201corigin divine.\u201d There are, it is true, laws of nations \u2014 perhaps it is to be wished that they were designated by another name \u2014 there are laws of nations which are founded altogether on human consent; of this kind are national treaties. But the municipal laws of a state are not more distinct from the law of nature than those consentual laws of nations are in their \u2022source and power distinct from the law of nations properly so called. Indeed those consentual laws of nations are not less controlled by the law of nations properly so called, than municipal laws are controlled by the law of nature. The law of nations is the law of states \u2022 and sovereigns. On \u25a0states and sovereigns it is obligatory in the same manner and for the same reasons, as the law of nature is obligatory upon individuals. Universal and unchangeable is the obligation of both. How great, how important, how interesting are these truths! They announce to a free people how solemn their duties are! If a practical knowledge and a just sense of those duties were diffused universally among the citizens, how \u2022beneficial and lasting would the fruits be! It seems to have been thought that the law of nations respects and regulates their conduct only in their intercourse with each other. A very important branch of this law containing the duties which a nation owes . to itself, has in a great measure escaped attention. Of a state, as well as of an individual, self-preservation is a primary duty. To love and to deserve an honest fame is another duty of a state as well as'of a man. To a state as well as to a man, reputation is a valuable and an agreeable possession. It represses hostility and secures esteem. In transactions with other nations, the dignity of a state should never be permitted to suffer the smallest diminution. Need it be mentioned here, that happiness is the cen-tre to which states as well as men are universally attracted! To consult its own happiness, therefore, is the duty of a nation. When men have formed themselves into a political society, they may reciprocally enter into particular engagements and contract new obligations in favour of the community or of its members. But they cannot, by this union, discharge themselves from any duties which they previously owed to those who form a part of the political association. Under all the obligations due to the universal society of the human race, the citizens of a state still continue. To this universal society it is a duty that each nation should contribute to the welfare, the perfection and the happiness of the others. If so, the first degree of this duty is to do no injury. Among states as well as among men, justice is a sacred law. This sacred law prohibits one state from exciting disturbances in another, from depriving it of its natural advantages, from calumniating its reputation, from seducing its citizens, from debauching the attachment of its allies, from fomenting or encouraging the hatred of its enemies. Vatt. Law Nat. 127. But nations are not only prohibited from doing evil, they are also commanded to do good to one another. On states as well as individuals the duties of humanity are strictly incumbent; what each is obliged to perform for others, from others it is entitled to receive. Hence the advantage as well as the duty of humanity. It may be uncommon, but it is unquestionably just to say, that nations ought to love one another. From the pure source of - benevolence the offices of humanity ought to flow. By a nation these enlarged and elevated virtues should be cultivated with peculiar assiduity and ardour; of an individual, however generous his disposition may be, the sphere of exertion is frequently narrow; but of a nation this sphere is comparatively boundless. By exhibiting a glorious example in her constitution, in her laws, and in the administration of her constitution and laws, she may diffuse instruction, she may diffuse reformation, she may diffuse happiness over the whole terrestrial globe. These maxims of national law, though the sacred precepts of nature, and of nature\u2019s God, have been too often unknown and unacknowledged by nations. Even where they have been known and acknowledged, their calm still voice has been drowned by the clamours of ambition and by the thunder of war.\nIs it then unnecessary or improper here to say, peace should \u25a0 be deemed the basis of the happiness of nations, \u201cpeace on earth!\u201d This is a patriotic as well as an angelic wish. But with war and rumours of war our ears in this imperfect state of things are still assailed. Into this unnatural state ought a nation to suffer herself to be drawn without her own act, or the act of him or them, to whom for this purpose she has delegated her power? Into this unnatural state should a nation suffer herself to be drawn by the unauthorized, nay by the unlicensed conduct of any of her citizens? These, gentlemen, are questions to which you are now called to give the closest and deepest attention. That a citizen, who in our state of neutrality, and without the au-' thority of the nation, takes an hostile part with either of the belligerent powers, violates thereby his duty, and the laws of his country, is a position so plain as to require no proof, and to be scarcely susceptible of a denial.\nUnder the treaty of amity and commerce between the United States and France, it may be made a question, whether the privateers of that power have a right to \u201cfit out their ships in our ports.\u201d This question arises from the twenty-second article of that treaty. \u201cIt shall not be lawful for any foreign privateers, not belonging to the subjects of his Most Christian Majesty, nor citizens of the United States, who have commissions from any other prince or state in enmity with either nation to fit out their ships in the ports of either the one or- the other of the aforesaid parties.\u201d It may be alleged, that this prohibition against fitting the ships of privateers belonging to any other nation implies a permission to fit the ships of privateers belonging to France.\u2014 But this inference cannot justly be drawn. If, by a promise made to one person, I restrain myself from lending money to any others, I am not surely by that restraining engagement, obliged to lend my money to him. It may be convenient, it may be necessary for me to reserve its application exclusively for my own purposes. In the same manner, by a stipulation, that in a war between France and Britain, we will not lend the use of our ports to the privateers of the latter, we are by no means obliged to lend it to those of the former. It may be convenient, it may be necessary for us to refuse it to both. True it is, that by the treaty we are obliged to refuse it to Britain, and this to one of the parties was probably an important object. But it remains in our option whether we will or will not grant it to France. \u2019 Both the nations which made this treaty, might have the most unexceptionable, nay, the most commendable motives for reserving to themselves this option. France, particularly, might have the strongest reasons for refusing to bind herself, at all events, to permit even the United States to fit out in her ports privateers against any nation however united to her by compact, with which the United States might be at war. This option, perhaps with France a favourite one, each of the parties to the treaty reserved the power of making. This option our nation, or its representatives for that purpose, have not yet made. This option private citizens are certainly unauthorized and unwarranted to make. Private citizens, therefore, assisting in a business of this kind, offend the law, and for their offences are amenable to the justice of the nation. If you know of any such, it is your duty to present them here.\nIn some instances citizens may be accountable for the conduct of their nation. In other instances the nation may be accounta- \u25a0 ble for the conduct of its citizens. It is impossible indeed that even in the best regulated state, the government should be able to superintend the whole behaviour of all the citizens and to restrain them within the precise limits of duty and obedience (Yatt. Law Nat. 144); it would be unjust, therefore, immediately to impute to the nation the faults or offences which its members may commit. In every state, disorderly \u2022citizens are unhappily to be found. Let such be held responsible, when they can be rendered amenable for the consequences of their, crimes and disorders. If the offended nation have the criminal in its power, it may without difficulty punish him, and oblige him to make satisfaction. Yatt. Law Nat. 145. Wheu the offending citizen escapes into his own country, his nation should oblige him to repair the damage, if reparation can be made, or should punish him according to the measure of his offence. Vatt. Law Nat. 75; Burrows, 1480 ; 4 Bl. Comm. 08, 69. If the nation refuse to do either, it renders itself in some measure an accomplice in the guilt, and becomes responsible for the injury. Vatt. Law Nat 145. To what does this responsibility lead? To reprisal certainly (Vatt. Law Nat. 251); and if so, probably to war (Id. 2; 4 Bl. Comm. 68, 69). And should the fortunes or the lives of millions be placed in either of those predicaments by the conduct of one citizen, or of a few citizens? Vatt. Law Nat. 2, 89. Humanity and reason say no. The constitution of the United States says no. Id. 2, 89. By that constitution, many great powers are vested in the first executive magistrate: others are vested in him, \u201cby and with the advice and consent of the senate.\u201d But neither he, nor he and they in conjunction, can lift up the sword of the United States. Congress alone have power to declare war, and to \u201cgrant letters of marque and reprisal.\u201d Who indeed should have the power to declare war but these, as the immediate representatives of those who mustfur-nish the blood and treasure upon which .war depends? With regard to this very interesting power, the constitution of the United States renews the principles known and practised in England before the conquest. This indeed may be reckoned one of the chief differences between the government of the Saxons and that of the Normans. In the former, the power of peace and war was invariably possessed by the Witten-agemote (Millar, Eng. Const. 305), and was regarded as inseparable from the allodial condition of its members. In the latter, it was transferred to the king; and this branch of the feudal system, which was accommodated .perhaps to the depredations and internal commotions prevalent in that rude period, has remained in subsequent ages, when from a total change of manners, the circumstances by which it was recommended, have no longer any existence. There is, by the way, a pleasure in reflecting on such important renovations of the venerable Saxon government; and in discovering that our national constitution is rendered illustrious by the antiquity, as well as by the excellence of some of its leading principles.\nThe principle now under our view was urged as one reason why this constitution should be adopted by Pennsylvania: if urged with propriety then, it may be urged with propriety now. For what was then adopted, ought now to be supported. \u201cThis system will not hurry us into war. It is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress. For the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large. \u2014 This declaration must be made with the concurrence of the house of representatives. From this circumstance we may draw a certain conclusion, that nothing but our national interest will draw us into a war.\u201d I cannot forbear on this occasion, the pleasure of mentioning to you the sentiments of the great and benevolent man, whose works I have already quoted (Mr. Neckar), who has addressed this country in language important and applicable, in the strictest manner, to its situation, and to the present subject. Speaking of war, and the great caution that all nations ought to use, in \u2019order to avoid its calamities \u2014 \u201cAnd you, rising nation.\u201d says he, \u201cwhom generous efforts have freed from the yoke of Europe! Let the universe be struck with still greater reverence- at the sight of the privileges you have acquired, by seeing you continually employed for the public felicity. Do not offer it as a sacrifice at the unsettled shrine of political ideas, and of the deceitful combinations of warlike ambition: avoid, or at least delay, participating in the passions of our hemisphere; make your own advantage of the knowledge which experience alone has given to our old age, and preserve for a long term, the simplicity of childhood; in short, honour human nature by showing, that when left to its own feelings, it is still capable of those virtues that maintain public order, and of that prudence which ensures public tranquil-lity.\u201d Deb. Oonv. Pa. 434. On this great subject of peace and war, the voice of all France is responsive to the language of our national constitution. \u201cWhen the interesting question was before her national assembly, its deliberations, we are told, were watched with anxiety by countless thousands. All Paris was in agitation, and when the decree was pronounced, that the lives and fortunes of twenty-five millions of men should not be at the disposal of a single individual, there was a shout of acclamation raised, which reached from the garden of the Tuileries to the extremest province of France.\u201d Can we believe, for a moment, that this generous nation would wish to bereave us of a security, which they themselves so highly and so justly prize?\nOn July 27, 1793, the following indictment was returned by the grand jury:\nAt a special circuit court of the United States for the

States.\n3\nW. Rawle,\nAttorney of the United States in and for the Pennsylvania District.\nHilary Baker, Esq., sworn,\nLewis Deblois, Esq., sworn,\nJohn Morgan, sworn,\nJames Bassett, sworn.\nIt appeared in evidence that Gideon Hen-field was a citizen of the United States and that his family resided in Salem, Massachusetts. Being a sea-faring man he had been \u2022absent from them some time, and about the 1st of May, 1793, being then at Charleston, South Carolina, and desirous of coming to Philadelphia, he applied to the master of a packet, who asked him more for his passage than he could afford to pay, whereupon he \u2022entered on board the Citizen Genet, a French privateer, commissioned by the French Republic and commanded by Pierre Johannen. Captain Johannen, it appeared, promised him the berth of prize-master on board the first prize they should capture, and the ship William, belonging to British subjects, naving been captured about the 5th of May, he was put on board her as prize-master, with another person, and arrived in that capacity at Philadelphia. It appeared that on his examination before the magistrate, he protested himself an American, that as such he would die, and therefore could not be supposed likely to intend anything to her prejudice. He declared if he had known it to be contrary to the president\u2019s proclamation, or even the wishes of the president, for whom he had the \u2022greatest respect, he would not have entered on board. About a month afterwards, being before the same magistrate, he declared he had espoused 'the cause of France, that be now considered himself as a Frenchman, and meant to move his family within their dominions.\nMr. Rawle, district attorney, with whom was Mr. Randolph, attorney general, made the following points:\n1. Every member is accountable to society for those actions which may affect the interest of that society.\n2. The United States being in perfect peace with all nations, and allied in friendly bonds with some, their national situation requires a perfect neutrality from every motive applicable to our common interest .\n3. An aggression on the subjects of other nations done in an hostile manner and under colour of war is a violation of that neutrality.\n4. If not under the colour of war it would be an act of piracy. But by the laws of nations if one of the belligerent powers should capture a neutral subject fighting under a commission from the other belligerent powers he could not punish him as a pirate, but must treat him as an enemy, and it would be a good cause of declaring war against the nation to which he belonged; and if treated as an enemy without just cause it is the duty of the nation to which he belongs to interfere in his behalf; and thus arises another cause of war. Hence the act of the individual is an injury to the nation, and the right of punishment follows the existence of the injury.\n5. The right of peace and war is always vested in the government. In the United States, but congress alone possesses it. By the formation of the society every individual' has consented to its being thus exclusively deposited for the general benefit. No individual, therefore, can assume the exercise of this right. For if one could do it one thousand might, and while the government declared peace the tragedy of war would be acted in its defiance.\n6. If one individual has a right to associate with the subjects of one of the belligerent powers, another individual has an equal right to do the same with the other belligerent power; thus the citizens of the neutral nation might be fighting with each other. Under this unhappy prospect, the national character and existence of America are lost; and instead of being members of a great nation, we become a band of miserable Algerines.\n7. The facts here show: \u25a0 (1) That Henfield is a citizen and inhabitant, though after-wards he takes counsel and alters his note. (2) That he entered on board the privateer, Citizen Genet, at Charleston. (3) That she was a commissioned vessel. (4) That he aided and assisted in taking the prize, and came in on board her as prize-master. The sufferings and character of Henfield can have no operation here: it is a point for the court, and no justification. France is at war with Austria, Spain, Portugal, and Sardinia, with whom we are at peace; with Great Britain, with whom a treaty of peace exists; and with the United Netherlands and Prussia, with whom there is peace, amity, and-commerce. To the first two we are related as having neither, given nor received offence. But the want of a treaty with them will not justify the individual in his aggression on them. With Great Britain is a treaty of peace, by article 7 of which it is provided that there shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, and the subjects of the one and the citizens of the other. With the United Netherlands and Prussia, treaties not only of peace but of mutual friendship and liberal commerce. The commission under which the proceedings of defendant took place is generally against all these powers, though actual aggression is charged as to one only. That one is one with whom we have a treaty of peace, which is the supreme law of the land, and this is \u2022the positive prohibitory law. Thus, an infraction of this kind, unless punished, becomes a good cause of war on the part of the offended nation. Vatt. Law Nat. bk. 4, \u00a7 52; Bynk. bk. 1, p. 178, c. 8. It is an offence against our own country, at common law, because the right of war is vested in the government only. Puff. Law Nat. bk. 8, c. 6, \u00a7 8; Vatt Law Nat. bk. 3, \u00a7 4; Id. bk. 4, \u00a7 223. In a state of nature the right adhered to the individual. It is lost by joining society. The common welfare requires this position in its fullest extent, otherwise a few individuals, for avaricious purposes, might involve the nation in a war; otherwise, the members of the nation, taking opposite sides, might destroy the nation in detail (Vatt. Law Nat. bk. 3, \u00a7 8); otherwise, the primary duty due from the citizen to the nation would remain unperformed while his labours and his life were devoted to the service of foreigners. Nor are-these only the speculations of the closet. We see them carried into effect in England in-affirmation of national common law, i. e. the law of nations. 4 Bl. Comm. 69. The English statute is not in force here, because the specific remedy for which alone it was made cannot be had, but the law which it aided, not introduced, is in force. The law of nations is part of the law of' the land. 4 Bl. Comm. 60; [Respublica v. De Longchamps] 1 Dali. [1 U. S.] Ill; C. L. lib. This is an offence against the laws of nations. It is punishable by indictment on information as such. [Respublica v. De Longchamps] 1 Dali. [1 U. S.] 114, &c.; 3 Burrows, 1480. It is. agreed that the laws of nations point out different methods of proceedings: \u2014 (1) By the belligerent power treating the offenders as. pirates. (2) By negotiation, or the declaration of war. But the answer is that these are concurrent remedies.\nTrue, that some writers say they may be treated, as pirates, and certain, that they may be treated as enemies. But these do not preclude the national right of proceeding against the delinquents judicially. 3 Bl. Comm. 2. 3, 4, &c. So a man may defend himself against violence, but the assailant may be-indicted. A man may peaceably retake his own property, but he may also have a re-plevin. A man may enter,. &c., but he may have his ejectment. The same observations, apply to negotiation. We may negotiate as. well on national as on private concerns, but without prejudice to the judicial remedy. But it is the honour of free states that the judicial remedy is necessary. 4 Bl. Comm. 67. That the executive should be inadequate to sudden and unusual exertions of power is our pride and happiness; and that our courts should, with that impartial and unbiased dignity which characterizes their judicial investigations of truth, apply the law of nations to men, of which nations are composed, and substitute the scales of justice for the sword of war.\nBut it is said that there is a want of precedent for this prosecution. The first answer is, that it is demonstrated that the law of nations is part of the law of the land. The second answer is, that in numerous other instances, enumerated by Blackstone, the law of nations is enforced by the judiciary. In cases of this nature, we find provisions have been made by statute in affirmance of the law, providing more speedy and specific relief than the common course of the law will admit. Thus the 31 Hen. VI. c. 4, was passed, and then, 3 Jae. I. c. 4, which makes it felony to go out of the realm to serve a foreign prince without oath of allegiance. That an indictment will lie on the latter is un\u2022questionable. On the former, see 3 Bnlst. 28 \u2014 a case in point.\nIt is urged, also, that the right of emigration is natural to freemen. It is no crime to become a French subject, and being a French subject, the defendant may lawfully \u2022enlist in this command. The answer is, that when a man has fairly and deliberately emigrated \u2014 when he has renounced his own country, and has been received and .domiciliated by the other \u2014 when all this has been done previously to the commission of the hostile act, and without a view to it, there is no offence in an act' of this kind. But the power of emigrating, and the power of renouncing the original country, are widely different Te emigrate is declared to be, in most instances, lawful for a private citizen, in some it is dishonourable \u2014 as to leave a country under difficulties, as in a dangerous war, &c. But, at all events, if at the time the act was \u2022committed, the party was unquestionably a citizen, had not renounced his country, and was not domiciliated elsewhere, he cannot escape punishment by becoming a citizen after-wards. Still less, when as expressly stated and proved, he was then an inhabitant. Is not the defendant\u2019s family still at Massachusetts? Is he not still upon the roll of their citizens; were his family in want, would they not be entitled to public relief? Did he not declare that, as an American he would die? It is said, it is true, that without actual expatriation, a freeman, in a free country, may consistently with the law of nations enter as' a volunteer. 2 Lee, 251. The answer is to be found in Vatt. Law Nat. lib. 3, \u00a7 13, in addition to what is already cited.\n2. The principles of Lee are as questionable as those of Vattel.are solid. It is prostrating the right of civil society, to support the right of man in a state of nature. The latter is destructive to civil society \u2014 which is instituted to prevent the pernicious effects of those rights. Grotius, whom he quotes, does not say so. Grotius treats simply of the right of emigrating, and there is not a syllable of the matter treated on by Lee in the whole section of Grotius. Grot. lib. 2, c. 5, \u00a7 24. But in the same section Grotius very justly says, that one ought not to go out of a state, when the interest of the state requires otherwise. And surely the interest of the state is affected by going out for these purposes. Lee himself excepts those states in which it was not allowable by the custom,, as he terms it. That this is the case in England is in proof. And it has not been altered here. The bill of rights declares, emigration shall not be prohibited.\nIt is contended, however, that the act done \u2014having been done on board the vessel \u2014 it is there French country, and the act there is lawful. The answer is, that in no respect is a foreign vessel a foreign country. Suppose the defendant had on board that vessel committed a private offence, the indictment lays it as having been done by a citizen \u2014 an inhabitant. There is really no technical difficulty. The evidence comes fully up to the case. The defendant was in Charleston; he there entered the vessel, and to argue that the instrument by which the offence is committed shall protect him from punishment, is an absurdity. By this the old doctrine of deo-dands is reversed; there the instrument partook of the offence; here the offender is to be incorporated into the innocence of the instrument. Let us suppose America engaged in war, and that one of her faithless children prefers the other party, joins an hostile detachment which has already invaded his own country, or enters on board a foreign privateer lying in our bay, and commits those acts, which in war are lawful, in peace, crimes. Does the right to emigrate, the right to choose his country, to renounce his former allegiance protect him here? It will be said that this is not a parallel case. What is the difference? (1) The offender in the latter case has a right to leave one country and become a citizen of another. (2) He has a right to disengage himself entirely from the obligations of duty and obedience to the first country. (3) The act of joining the other country, of itself, exempts him from those primary obligations. So far, the parallel is exact. To escape its effect, it may be asserted, fhat a man can never lift his hand against his native country. But, then, what becomes of all these rights? If the slavish doctrine of an unalienable allegiance is admitted, it totally destroys the right of emigration.\nThus after all this circuit we are let down where we began, viz: That the emigration from one country and the reception in another must be substantially and definitely effected before the acts of hostility. Let it not be said that this doctrine violates the rights of man. It is on the rights of man that it is established. The rights of man are the rights of all men in relation to each other, and when voluntarily assumed in society founded on principles of genuine freedom, they form a useful, benevolent, and endearing system, in which as much is received as is given. Perfect equality is one of those rights. We render ourselves equal when we all submit to the laws. That equality is destroyed if one man Gan set himself above them. That equality is destroyed if one man with impunity may involve three millions in war. With the honour of being the first in the eighteenth century to unfurl the standard of freedom we unite the glory of being the first in the records of man who deliberately composed a constitution of government, combining every noble, every useful, every rational, every patriotic object, and containing within itself the means of acquiring and securing them all. Of this the prominent effects strike the most careless eye. The world does not exhibit a fairer picture of felicity, more useful industry, more wholesome \u25a0laws, more public and private virtue, more genuine and uniform improvement, more to attract the admiration of the traveller and secure the affections of the citizen than the land we inhabit Yet it is on such a country that inconsiderate and selfish men would pour the miseries of war. Is it not fair to ask them by what authority have you or I delegated to an individual the right of subjecting us to the pressure of heavy taxes, to the desolation of property, to the destruction of agri\u2022culture and of commerce, to the dangers of military service, in short, to the havoc and miseries of war? Has Pennsylvania, have the United States? No. Our excellent constitution has wisely vested this solemn, awful step in the collected wisdom and patriotism of the whole country. There the necessity of the war and the means of defence will he compared by men selected by their country and responsible to it, but not by men who involve us in what they profess they will not share with us, and in the very act which draws on us the greatest political affliction renounce the very connexion which has alone rendered us liable for their conduct. Have the convention of Prance requested it? No. They have requested our neutrality. The French people who assisted us formerly did it under the sanction and approbation of their sovereign. Instead, however, of his having no power over them, as stated by the other side, .the operation of most positive and powerful laws was suspended, with a view to that public assistance which afterwards took place. 2 Yatt. Law Nat. 235. The intention of France was soon known; she declared herself when she thought the time mature.\n4\nMr. Duponceau, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Sergeant addressed the jury at great length; and insisted\u2014\n1. That the indictment did not include an offence at common law.\n2. That if the president\u2019s proclamation created such an offence, the case before the court was committed before the proclamation was made.\n3. That though the treaty with Morocco prohibited the enlisting of American citizens under such circumstances as the present, yet there was no such provision in the treaty with France, and hence the inference from Its express introduction into the former treaty is that it was intentionally omitted from the latter.\n4. That independently of these grounds, as there was no statute giving jurisdiction, the court could take no cognizance of the offence.\nOn the question under the laws of nations were cited, 6 Hume, Hist. Eng. 433; 1 Hutch. Hist Mass. Bay, 251; 3 Vatt. Law Nat. 15; Bynk. 22d, c.; Syn. Gal.

Under the constitution of the United States, treaties with foreign nations comprise a portion of the public and supreme law of the land, and a violation of such treaty by a citien of the United States may be punished in the federal courts by indictment.)\n[2. The participation by the citizens of a neutral' state in an attack by one belligerent power upon another is an offense against the law of nations, and may be punished as such by such neutral state.)\n[3. Though there may have been no exercise of the power conferred upon congress by the constitution \u201cto define and punish offenses against the law of nations,\u201d the federal judiciary has jurisdiction of an offense against the law of nations, and may proceed to punish the offender according to the forms of the common law; and it seems that the federal courts have common-law cognizance of offenses against the sovereignty of the United States.)\n[Whart St. Tr. 49.)\n1 This prosecution, which has been referred to frequently in the subsequent reports as the earliest case on the subject of the common law jurisdiction of the federal courts, and which was considered of so much importance by General Washington, as to justify a special meeting of congress, and by Mr. Jefferson as to require a distinct explanation to the British government, is now for the first time reported. The charges of Chief Justice Jay and Judge Wilson, it is true, were printed by the govern-ment for the purpose of explaining abroad the position of the United States, but they have never yet been presented to the professional eye. Fortunately, however, among the papers of the late Mr. Rawle, who, as district attorney, conducted the prosecution; and those of Mr. Du-ponceau, who, with Mr. Sergeant and Mr. In-gersoll, were counsel for the defence, the editor has been enabled to discover notes which give an almost complete report of the case. The causes which led to it are best given by the following letters, which were obtained from the .-same source, and which are'now for the first time published:\nMr. Hammond to Mr. Jefferson.\nThe undersigned, his Britannic Majesty\u2019s Minister Plenipotentiary to the .United States \u25a0of America, has 'the honour of informing the Secretary of State, that he has received intelligence from his Majesty\u2019s Consul, at Charleston, South Carolina, that two privateers have been fitted out from that port under French commissions. They carry six small guns, and are \u25a0navigated by forty or fifty men, who are, for the most part, citizens of the United States. One of these privateers left the harbour of Charleston on the 18th ult., and the other was \u2022on the 22d ready to depart.\nThe undersigned does not deem it necessary to \u2022enter into any reasoning upon these facts, as he conceives them to be breaches of that neutrality which the United States profess to observe, and direct contraventions of the proclamation which the president issued upon the '22d of last month. Under this impression, he doubts not that the executive government of the United States, will pursue such measures as to its wisdom may appear the best calculated for repressing such practices in future, and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which these particular privateers may attempt to bring into any of the ports of the United States.\nGeo. Hammond.\nPhiladelphia, 8th May, 1793.\nThe Secretary of State.\nNorfolk, May 5, 1793.\nSir: We have taken the liberty, considering it a duty, to give you information of two schooner boats, cruizing off our capes, as privateers, under French commissions, who are \u25a0daily chasing vessels bound in and out, to the great prejudice of our trade, and contrary to the law of nations to be chasing and boarding vessels within our territories. One of these vessels is called the Sans Culotte, and commanded by a Mr. Farre, the other called the Eagle; they are about the size of the largest pilot bbats, and rigged as they are, mounting four carriage guns each, and fitted from Charleston. By reference to Captain Tucker\u2019s report, you will find how the Sans Culotte is manned; and from report of negro Caesar, the pilot, the Eagle has but one Frenchman on board her, the others Americans and Englishmen. One of these vessels belonged to Mr. Hooper, of Cambridge, in Maryland. Mr. Hooper is gone with Captain Tucker\u2019s vessel to that place, where his father lives, and Captain Tucker says, he understood she was to be laid up in some creek thereabouts. From the circumstances of erasing the name out of her stem, it appears as if some fraud was intended. We are, with the greatest respect, &c.,\nThos. Newton. Jr. .\nWm. Lindsay.\nCaptain Lindsay, of the schooner Greyhound, in twenty-three days from Jamaica, reports that he arrived here the 4th insfc That on the day before, about half past 11 o\u2019clock, a. m., he fell in with the pilot boat Ranger, of Hampton, belonging to Mr. Latimer, who hailed him and asked what vessel he commanded, to which he replied, the Greyhound of Norfolk, (Captain Lindsay having erased the name of the port he belonged to, and substituted Norfolk.) and added, that he was from St. Eustatius, upon which Mr. Latimer gave information to a small schooner privateer, at not more than twenty-four yards from them, and not a half mile from Cape Henry: by this deception. Captain Lindsay supposes, he escaped being taken.\nCaptain Tucker, of the schooner Eunice of New Providence, reports that he was, on the 29th last month, taken by a privateer schooner, called the Sans Culotte, commanded by Captain Farre, in the latitude 36, in 27 fathom water. That after being in possession of the privateer, the name of his schooner was erased from the stern, and a Mr. Hooper, of Cambridge, in the state of Maryland, was put on board as prize Blaster, and he understood she was to be carried there and laid up in some creek, and that Mr. Hooper was to go to Philadelphia on some business. That whilst he was prisoner, both the privateer and the prize came into Hampton Road, and lay in Hawkin\u2019s Hole part of two days and two nights, and then sailed out on a cruise. He says that a Major-General, of New England, was on board the privateer, and acted as a marine officer, and a lieutenant in the absence of Mr. Hooper.\nMr. Hooper owned the schooner Eagle, and plied from this to Georgia and Charleston as a packet. She was fitted originally from Cambridge. From every circumstance, Captain Tucker was of opinion, they would take vessels in the Bay of Chesapeake, as they lay along side one all night, but she proved to be an American vessel.\nMr. Jefferson to Mr. Rawle, Enclosing the Above.\nPhiladelphia, May 15, 1793.\nSir: By the enclosed papers, you will.perceive, there is reason to believe that certain citizens of the United States, have engaged in committing depredations on the property and commerce of some of the nations at peace with the United States. I have it in charge to express to you the desire of the government, that you would take such measures for apprehending and prosecuting them as shall be according to law. I am not able to point out to you the individuals against whom suggestions have been made, but take the\" liberty of referring you to Mr. Deblois and Mr. Sharpe Delany, who may give you information on the subject. I am, with great esteem, sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,\nTh.

Randolph, with marginal corrections, apparently by Mr. Hamilton:\n\u201cFor that, whereas, an open and notoriously public war for a long time bath been, and yet is, by sea and by land, had, carried on, and prosecuted between (here name the nations at war) \u2014during all which time a treaty of amity and \u2022commerce was, and still is in force between the \u2022said States General of the United Netherlands and the United States of America, whereby it is, among other things, provided that there shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace and \u00a1sincere friendship between their High Mighti-nesses the Lords the said States General of the United Netherlands and the U. S. of America, and between the subjects and inhabitants of the \u00a1said parties, and between the countries, islands, cities, and places situated under the jurisdiction of the said U. Nthds. and the said U. S. of America, their subjects and inhabitants of every \u2022degree, without exception of persons or places: And, whereas, by the constitution ordained and \u2022established for the said U. S. of A., it is, among \u25a0other things, provided that all treaties made, \u25a0or which shall be made, under the authority of \u25a0the U. S., shall be the supreme law of the land: And, whereas, at the time of the said war, by virtue of a certain commission and certain letters of marque and reprisal, granted by the Republic of France, a certain ship-of-war, called the Citizen Genet, was, among others, set out and equipped, of which a citizen of the said Republic of France was commander, with several other French citizens, to tne number of fifty persons, in a warlike manner, to take and \u2022destroy the ships, goods, and moneys (name the nations), and especially of the U. Nethds. and the subjects thereof, and against them to wage war on the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court. A. B., &e. (with the additions) being an inhabitant of the said U. S. of A. well knowing the premises, and intending and contriving, and with all his strength purposing to interrupt, destroy, and break the said firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship, as aforesaid, between the said U. Nethds. and the said U. S. of A. on the - day of -, &c., with force and arms, on the high seas, and within the jurisdiction of this court, unlawfully and maliciously did interrupt, destroy, and break the said firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship, between the said U. N. and the said U. S. of A., and that he, the said A. B., so being an inhabitant of the said U. S of A. on the same day and year aforesaid, on the high seas aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court, and being a- on board of the said -of war, unlawfully and maliciously sailed and cruised to several maritime places within the jurisdiction aforesaid, by force and arms to take the ships, goods, and moneys (name the nations), and especially of the said States General of the U.

There appears to me a passage important \u2022to Mr. Rawle \u2014 Questiones Juris Pub. lib. 1, chap, viii. p. 178. \u2014 I mean what relates to the people of Munster who made out of the territories of Spain incursions into those of Holland. It \u25a0shows by an example that military expeditions out of the territory of a neutral power cannot \u25a0rightfully be made by a power at war, and that if permitted the neutral nation is answerable. A fortiori, the means of such expeditions cannot be prepared in a neutral territory.\nA.\n[[Image here]]\n(From Mr. Randolph.)\nE. Randolph, with best respects to Mr. Rawle: \u2014 The nineteenth article of the Dutch treaty was adverted to; and it was presumed that you would operate with it, if any of the crew were found to come within the description. 'The captain of the privateer seems, from your information, to be of doubtful character. May it not. therefore, be advisable to inquire, whether he be an American or foreign citizen, before .you get into motion against him?\nSunday.\n5 Unfortunately for the profession the only notes the editor has been able to obtain of the argument for the defence are those taken at the time by Mr. Rawle. The newspapers, however, speak of the speeenes of both Mr. Sergeant and Mr. Ingersoll as of great power; and in the Daily Advertiser of August 5, 1793, a communication appears, in which, by a critic of no mean abilities, Mr. Sergeant\u2019s speech is referred to as most efficient and unanswerable. \u25a0"}}}, {"id": 6576212, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/6576212/", "name": "SHEDDEN v.

In the latter, exceptions to the jurisdiction must be pleaded; but in the former the defendant is not bound to plead it, for the plaintiff must entitle himself to sue there. If the declaration had alleged that the plaintiff was a foreigner, then the defendant must have plead\u2022ed the disability, as he would have admitted his capacity to sue. Ability to sue here is a fact which rests more in the knowledge of the plaintiff than of the defendant; and, therefore, the former should show himself capable of suing here. It is not the same with regard to the place of contract, for that the defendantknows as well as the plaintiff; and, therefore, if there be. any exceptions on that-ground, it being a thing in the knowledge of the defendant, he should plead it for the same reason that the plaintiff must aver his capacity in the other case.

CUSTIS.\n1793.\nMr. Wickham, for defendant.\nMr. Campbell, contra.\nThe plaintiff did not state himself in his declaration to be the subject or citizen of a foreign state; and the question was, if this' should be done, in order to show that the court had jurisdiction.\nJAY, Circuit Justice. If the court has not jurisdiction, it is on account of the disability of the person, which might be pleaded in abatement; and if it could be pleaded in abatement, then can the exception be taken advantage of, by motion in arrest of judgment, after verdict.\n, ; i The exception appears upon the face of the declaration. For the charge of jurisdiction in the declaration only states that the bond itself was made within the jurisdiction, but : says nothing as to the person of the plaintiff. Now, jurisdiction in this court respects the person, and not the place; for the court has jurisdiction as well over contracts made without. as those made within the limits of the ; state. The difference is, between courts of ; general, and those of limited jurisdiction. If the cause depended before the court of king's bench in England, or the general court here, and there had been any disability, it should have been pleaded; because their jurisdie- | tion is general. But the jurisdiction of this j court is limited, as to persons; and. there- ! fore, should he shown, as well as that of a court whose jurisdiction is limited as to loi-al- \u00a1 ity and extent. The common law authorities ! all show that jurisdiction should be averred; and though they may seem to differ, yet the : whole difference in any of them is only what ; amounts to a sufficient averment, on which the authorities do not agree. Now, the only ' difference between those cases and that at . bar is that those were inferior courts, and ! this a superior court; and therefore it ma.y i be argued that the cases in the former turned upon the inferiority of the court; but that argument is not satisfactory. .The true reason is, not that they were inferior, hut that they were limited courts. So this is. Therefore, the plaintiff must show that the court has a right to discuss his claims, and not merely that he has a right to the thing he claims.\nA motion to arrest a judgment must be grounded on error apparent on the record; and the question is of this case here. Something should manifestly appear to be erroneous; not whether, possibly so, or not The English authorities do not prove that disability may be urged after verdict The question, in all of them, was concerning the limits of the jurisdiction of the court where the actions were brought For, being inferior courts, the superior courts at Westminster confined them, both because .derogatory to the common law and for the sake of the venue. This, therefore, is a novel objection, and must stand on its own reasons. Some persons may sue here, \u00bfthere cannot. Therefore, the defendant must point out the disability; for the court will not inquire into circumstances, unless he shows it. Parties are only the instruments of jurisdiction; for the jurisdiction of the court is independent of parties. ' There must, indeed, be parties before the court; but jurisdiction consists in authority to decide rights. If the defendant does not show a want of jurisdiction, it shall be intended. Carth. 33, 34. The doctrine is, that by pleading you admit jurisdiction. It may be argued that consent does not give jurisdiction, but that is only where want of it appears of record. If, indeed, the declaration had stated that the plaintiff and defendant were both citizens of this state, the defendant\u2019s admission would not have given jurisdiction; but the party may dispense with facts if he will. Comb. 254. Therefore, as the case now stands, it is altogether a question as to the subject-matter of complaint, and if the plea does not state facts to oust jurisdiction, the court will intend it as admit-, ted. The court cannot judicially notice districts of country, or the kind of persons who sue, unless it be expressly submitted to them by the pleadings. But after issue joined on the merits, they will not receive proof of residence or other disability, but of the subject-matter in dispute only. For the plea answers the allegations with respect to the debt, and not of the person. If inconveniences should be alleged as that any citizen may sue here, the answer is, that the defendant may avail himself of the incapacity of the plaintiff to sue, by pleading, and if he does not, he must abide by it.\nWickham was about to reply, but was stopped by the court.\nCase No. 12,736.\nCourts \u2014 Federal Jurisdiction \u2014 Failure to State Citizenship in Declaration \u2014 How Taken Advantage op.\n1.

He is not interested in the event of the suit; nor can the verdict in this case be given in evidence upon the trial of the action for his commissions. Anderson was a known, established broker; and unless he was admitted to give evidence of the instructions he received (which were oral in this case, and are usually so in similar cases), it would be impracticable to ascertain the facts that are essential to enable tne court to decide upon the merits of the controversy.\nThe witness was thereupon admitted.\nH. To the action and declaration (which contained five counts), the following exceptions were taken, in the course of the de-fence: 1st. That the action is brought in the names of Brockholst and J. R. Livingston, whereas the contract in writing is made with J. R. Livingston only. 2nd. That the first count states an agreement by Swanwick to transfer stocks at a certain \u25a0 day, but the evidence is only of an agreement to deliver an engagement for that purpose. 3rd. That the second and fourth counts state an agreement by Swanwick to deliver an engagement to transfer stock to J. R. Livingston, or order, but the evidence does not prove that he engaged to transfer stock to the plaintiff's order. 4th. That the third count states a contract being made by Anderson, as the authorized agent of Swanwick, that Swan-wick should transfer stock to the plaintiff, but the evidence onty shows a contract by Anderson that there should be delivered to the plaintiff an engagement of Swanwick to transfer the stock. 5th. That the fifth count states the plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the place of transfer, but there is no proof of the fact. But the exceptions were considered and overruled, in the charge of the jury, of which, in that respect, the following is the substance:\nBY THE COURT. The objection to the form of the action ought not to prevail. The contract is proved by the testimony of Anderson, and the written paper is merely corroborative. At the time, then, of forming the contract, it was perfectly understood by the parties transacting the business that Brockholst and J. R. Livingston were jointly concerned; and, if the action had not been instituted in their joint names, it might have been pleaded in abatement. Nor is the objection to the variance between the declaration and the written contract, on account of the words \u201cor order\u201d being stated in the former, though not contained in the latter, material in point of law. It was unnecessary to set forth the written contract at all in tlie declaration; and it is only now offered as additional evidence to prove the parol bargain between the parties. In the case of a bond, bill of exchange, or promissory note, there would be more weight in the objection; because they are, exclusively, the evidence of the respective contracts to which they give existence, character, and operation; but the written paper, in the present instance, is of no more force, than any other testimony of its contents would be. The words in the declaration must, therefore, be considered as surplusage, and do not affect the material parts of the charge. As to the other variances between the contract as laid, and the written contract produced, the same principles will apply. And the nonattendance of the plaintiffs at the place of transfer is sufficiently excused by the waiver, which has been proved on the part of the defendant.\nVerdict for the plaintiffs for $19,400.", "author": "BY THE COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": ["Lewis, Rawle, Randolph & Dallas, for plaintiffs.", "R.

That on the night of the seventh of May last, the said brig, being on her voyage from the island of Jamaica to Baltimore and near Cape Henry, was hailed in the English language, from a small schooner, who enquired if they wanted a pilot; that they answered in the negative, and not suspecting they were near an enemy, continued their course all night, and at daybreak next morning, found themselves within five miles of Cape Henry, when and where they were boarded and made prize of by sundry armed men, belonging to the armed schooner Sans. Culottes, commanded by J. B. P. A. Ferey, and the officers and the crew of 1he said brig made prisoners. That the cargo enumerated in the libel was the property of the persons respectively therein named, being the libel-lants. That they do not admit that the said schooner was duly commissioned to capture British vessels or property. That the said brig at the time of her capture was on neutral ground, within the territorial jurisdiction and under the protection of the United States, who are now at peace with the king and people of Great Britain: and the said J. Ferey had no authority or permission from the United States to capture British vessels or property within that distance from the sea coast, lo which by the laws of nations and those of the United .States the right and jurisdiction of the United States extend. They, therefore, pray restitution of vessel and cargo, and damages for detention.\nTo this libel J. B. P. A. Ferey put in a plea to the jurisdiction of the court: and in his plea sets forth: That he was at the time of the capture of the brig Fanny duly commissioned by the French republic, as captain on board the armed schooner Sans Culottes, belonging to citizens of the said republic, to attack all the enemies of the said republic wherever he might find them, &c., which commission he is now ready to shew, &c. That so being commissioned he took as prize, the said brig, &e., belonging to British subjects, at open war with the French republic, and brought her as prize into the port of Philadelphia, &e. That by the laws of nations, and the treaty of amity and commerce with France, it doth not pertain to this court to hold plea, &c. He. therefore, prays to be hence dismissed, and the brig and cargo discharged from arrest, &c. A copy of the commission, as stated in the plea, was shewn and by consent, was admitted.\nThe libellants reply, that the libel ought not to be dismissed, because: (11 That the brig Fanny and cargo were unlawfully seized and taken within the territorial limits of the United States, by the said J. B. P. A. Ferey, and divers citizens of the United States, the said United States then and now being at peace with the king and people of Great Britain. (2) That the said schooner Sans Culottes was unlawfully armed, manned, vic-tualled and fitted out within the United States, with the citizens thereof on board her, to cruize within the domain and territorial jurisdiction thereof, against, the king and people of Great Britain, and against the citizens and subjects of Holland, with whom the United States were then and now are at peace. (3) They deny that the said .T. B. P. A. Ferey was duly commissioned; or that the schooner Sans Culottes belonged to the citizens of France, at the time of the pretended commission; or that the French republic then had any authority to grant a commission for her to cruize, as an armed vessel, against the friends of the United States. They, therefore pray sentence according to the prayer of the libel.\nThe defendant rejoins by protestation, &c. and relies on his plea as before stated. The several matters mentioned in the replication in addition to those in the libel were abandoned, or were not insisted on by the advocates for the libellants, and the cause put on the ground of the libel. The arguments were much the same with those in the former cause of Findlay v. The William [Case No. 4,790], with the addition of some new matter; and, therefore. I consider this in the nature of a re-hearing of the point determined in that cause.\nThe arguments, either explanatory or adj j I ditional, seem to be: (1) That by the more ancient authorities (Lex Merc. 206, 207, 227; Inst. Adm. 7, 219; Molloy, 41, bk. 1, c. 2, \u00a7 21), it appears that, if at that day, the prize was carried into neutral territory, the admiralty might restore, and the owners were not divested of the property, if it were not carried infra praesidia of the captors, and condemned in a court of admiralty. It is allowed that the custom of selling prizes in neutral ports, has altered this law; but the authorities shew that, before the custom of selling, the courts had jurisdiction, and if the property were not changed, before this practice of selling took place, it is not changed here, because taken in neutral territory, and the capture unlawful; and, therefore, the courts here have the jurisdiction the admiralty possessed before this custom of selling prevailed. (2) That the act of taking being illegal, it can give no right. Every sovereign is owner of the soil of his country, and the jurisdiction over a certain extent of sea-coast, and this jurisdiction should be acknowledged by the whole world. And though it is not well settled how .far territorial limits extend on sea-coasts, the most approved writers agree the distance to be three leagues. That within these limits thqre is no war: and, therefore, there can be no prizes lawfully made. That the laws of nations forbid fitting out privateers in a neutral country, or capturing within its limits, friends of the neutral. These acts are penal and liable to punishment. If the property is not restored and compensation made, it is a cause of war, as it also is if neutral territory is invaded by the nations respectively affected by either of these circumstances. And, if we shall be under the necessity of paying for the property taken in our territory, the captors will, in part, carry on their war at our expense. It is acknowledged, that we have no concern with captures lawfully made; but this is no lawful capture, and we have a right to exercise our jurisdiction in this case. The proper means to do this is through our courts of justice, who have cognizance of all invasions of our jurisdiction and territorial rights. (3) That we do not here investigate the question of prize, but pursue a remedy for a marine trespass, a subject evidently within the jurisdiction of our admiralty courts. (4) That, however it may be with the sovereignties of other nations, ours is divided into executive, legislative, and judiciary; and by the constitution, the judiciary have cognizance of all eases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. It, there-j fore, rests with them to give a remedy in all such cases, and this court is particularly by law vested with authority where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the laws of nations, &e. \u2014 and this is a case falling under that description. (5) Much argument and discussion were used on the subject of Palachi\u2019s Case [1 Bolle, 175], It was said that this case was originally a prosecution for piracy under a British statute: and therefore the reasoning and determination of the judges do not apply to it. But by the same case, as reported in Bulstrode [3 Bulst. 28], it appears that a prohibition was refused to the admiralty who took cognizance civilly and adjudged restitution. That the cases on which the report in the Exposition de Motifs, &c. was made were different from the present case; and, therefore the positions of those who made that report being founded on the cases under their consideration, do not, in any respect, apply to the case in question. It was, however, agreed that whatever-be the proper decision as to legality of prize, or limits of territory, the question always recurs. \u2014 What department of government is vested with the power of enquiring into it, and giving the remedy? To these were added many arguments of inconvenience and policy. The prize here may be sold without inquiry, if this court will not make it; but in France their courts would examine into circumstances and prevent injustice. If the capture is wrongfully made, the captor will not carry it to France; and even there, in the case of the most valuable ship, there is nothing to which the injured party can resort but the privateer bond; therefore, if carried to France, restoration would be made if the capture is illegal. But here if the court will not take cognizance, it must be sold, and there is an end of redress. By bringing property into our ports captors submit to our jurisdiction. That the silence of the books is owing to admiralty cases not being published, and cases of plunder brought into neutral ports are uncommon.\nOn the part of the captors the arguments made use of in the ease of Findlay v. The William [supra], were repeated, and much was said in answer to the reasoning of, and authorities produced by, the advocates for the libellants.\nThe doctrines laid down in the exposition, &c. were relied on as to the law of nations, and the treaty was called the sheet-anehor on which the captors depended. It was contended that the treaty forbids the courts from interfering, but the right of diplomatic interference was not denied; nor were the arguments on this side extended further than as the subject related to captures by one enemy from another. An objection was taken to the parties libellants, who, it was said, had no power to sue and recover on the point of violation of territory, which did not give rights to parties at war, but merely affected the neutral nation. It was acknowledged that a capture in_a neutral territory was an offense to the neutral, and that the neutral government might order restitution. But this is a matter of state policy, not of judicial proceeding. If the United States were a party, it might alter the case; but here ar\u00e9 only belligerent parties. That as to the Case of Palachi, in 3 Bulst. 28, it must be misreported, or some circumstances existed, not now appearing, as it differs in the general positions from those laid down by my Lord | Coke in his Institutes, Avhere civil as well as criminal proceedings are mentioned. That the authorities out of Sir Leoline Jenkins are all founded on references from the king to him, and he does not give judgment, but refers the remedies to royal authority.\nThe doctrine of infra praesidia was denied, and it was asserted that the property was vested by capture as to the enemy; that though it may be trespass as to the neutral, the taking vests the right in the captor, and the trespass done to the neutral is a subject for him to enquire into and obtain redress, but not for the party at war. And it appears by the British instructions to their privateers, that they are of opinion that a prize may be taken on neutral ground if the government of the neutral permits it. That if there are no adjudged cases in favour of the captors, there are none on the other side, and both are on an equal footing in this respect.\nOne of the advocates entered largely into the point of territorial limits, and shewed the uncertainty in which it was involved. It was said that these limits must be settled by treaty; and by treaty, if it were deemed right, a power in the neutral courts to judge of prizes taken in neutral bounds ought to have been vested, for it cannot be assumed without the consent of the sovereign of the party making the capture. The inequality of remedy was also insisted on; there can be no reciprocity, where the one party may be obliged to restore, but cannot have condemnation of the capture.\nI have re-considered the arguments adduced on a former occasion as well as those brought forward in this case. I shall say nothing on the new ground taken in the replication, because it is not insisted on by the replicants. This being a public point, I have been desirous of hearing all that could be said upon it; If I am still of the same opinion I delivered in the former case, it is not because I indulge the petty and inflexible pride of consistency, but because I am not convinced that my former decree was erroneous. It is not with pleasure, that I continue to differ with the advocates for the libellants in this or the former cause: I have a sincere deference for their opinions in general, but my duty will always prompt me to follow the impressions the subject produces in my own mind. If these are erroneous they must be set right by an appeal /to a superior tribunal, in whose decision I shall very cheerfully acquiesce. I shall be obliged to be' more diffuse than, in common cases I wish to be. as the subject has been ably and extensively discussed by the advocates on both sides of the question, and it is a point of public consequence. I will avoid, however, as much as possible, going into minute investigation, and confine myself, chiefly, to general principles.\nThe doctrine, advanced on the part of the libellants, that it is necessary for the complete transfer of property to the captors, that the prize should be carried into their tern-tories and there condemned, seems to present itself as the first object of investigation. It appears to me that much- of the argument, founded on the authority of the old eases is built on this doctrine. I am not satisfied that this opinion was at any time well founded. If the old cases produced shew that prizes brought in solo amici, were considered as subjects of cognizance in neutral courts, because the capture was not complete, not being carried infra praesidia of the captors, I cannot be convinced that they should have the weight contended for, if they were nor more explicit and certain than they appear to be. Lex Merc. 206, 7, 227. And I think that on a careful inspection of most of these cases it will be seen that the civilians (Molloy, 41; Inst. Adm. 219) then foimded their opinions as to admiralty jurisdiction, in captures brought in solo amici, upon this principle. If this were the case, these authorities ought not to govern us; \u2022 cessante ratione, cessat lex. To adduce them to shew that courts now have the authority exercised when the doctrine of infra praesidia prevailed, in cases of illegal captures, does not strike me forcibly; because, if the authority was then assumed on fallacious principles, it amounts to nothing more than to found one error upon another.\nThe general positions (Grotius, de Jure B. lib. 3, c. 6, \u00a7 3, note 3), that the property taken is not changed until brought into the ports of the captors, appears, even by the old authorities, merely to relate to the rights of postlimine and salvage, on re-capture.' The instance of captures at sea, given by Grotius, recognizes the true reason on- which ancient writers found their opinions, viz. that \u201cthe capture is then complete when all hope of recovery is lost.\u201d It is lost if carried within a fleet of the sovereign of the captor, or, \u201cby the modern law of nations, it is sufficient if these kinds of things have been during twenty-four hours in the power of him who took them from his enemy.\u201d Freem. 40. Goods taken from an enemy on land and recaptured, shall be the property of the re-captor, unless re-taken the same day and claim put in before sunset. Byfiker de R. B. lib. 4. Goods or ships must be brought into port and continue infra praesidia a night, \u201cso that all hope of recovery be lost.\u201d\n\u2019It is then, only required that \u201call hope of recovery be lost,\u201d to establish the principle; and the going into the territory, &c. are only mentioned as instances and not requisites; so that it does not appear by these authorities, some of which- are .cotemporary with \u25a0Palachi\u2019s case, that it was essential to a complete capture, that it should be carried into the captor\u2019s territory. Burlamaqui, 233, 234. Burlamaqui has cleared up this point in his Principles of Politic Law (chapter 7, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 17): \u201cThe prizes taken from an enemy become the property of the captor as soon as .they are taken. The truth is, this distinction\u201d (carrying or not infra praesidia) \u201chas been invented only to establish the -rules of the right of postlimine or the manner in which tie subjects of the state, from whence something has been taken in war, re-enter upon their rights, rather than to determine the time of the acquisition of things taken by one enemy, from another.\u201d\nIn the case of Goss v. Withers, in 2 Burrows, 683 (Just. Inst. bk. 2, tit. 1, \u00a7 17), this doctrine is discussed. It is there shewn, that the enemy acquire a property by the mere occupation, where all hope of recovery is lost. \u00c1 case mentioned in page 694 of that book, was on a former occasion relied on, as bearing on the case in question.\nRestitution to the British owner was decreed against a vendee or re-captor, in the time of Charles the Second, of a ship having been fourteen weeks in the possession of-the enemy, and re-taken by a British privateer. Another is there cited from Lucas, p. 79, upon the same principles, against a vendee, after a long possession, two sales and several voyages. Yet Woodeson (volume 2, p. 441) expressly says, that \u201cby alienation of a capture to subjects of a neutral power, the property is become irretrievable as to the original proprietors,\u201d and vide post, 443. But Lord Mansfield justly observes, that most of the rules on this subject are arbitrary, and not the object of reason alone. They are contrivances of nations in favour of their own subjects and to prevent .too easy . transfers to neutrals. Every nation (Burlamaqui, 224), for the benefit of its own citizens, makes what rules it pleases as to the recovery by the owner of the property re-taken. But what has a neutral court to do with such arrangements? They relate to the adjustment of salvage between subjects of the same nation, but have no operation between one enemy and another. For with respect to them, \u201cthe ship is lost by the capture though she be never condemned at all, nor carried into any port or fleet of the enemy.\u201d Goss v. Withers, 2 Burrows, 683. If then the ship is lost to the enemy, from whom it is captured (the mere capture being held sufficient to ground a claim of insurance) what new title can he acquire by coming into the port of neutral and becoming party to a suit for recovery of his former property? The court were of opinion, in the case first mentioned, that the question \u201cwhether by the capture the property was or was not transferred to the enemy,\u201d could only happen in two cases. 1st. Between the owner and a neutral purchaser. 2d. Between the. owner and the recaptor. If a third case had existed, my Lord Mansfield was too accurate not to have added it, to wit \u2014 between the owner and his enemy in a neutral court. But he had given a contrary opinion, and knew no such case ought to occur. Tide Bynkers. de R. B.- bk. 1, c. 15, p. 191.\nIt therefore seems to me that cases, grounded on the doctrine of infra praesidia, and condemnation in a court of admiralty of the captors, are not sufficient guides in this question. All that is said about this doctrine is not to be understood as relating to the parties at war; for, as to them, the capture is complete when made. But in support of the rights of postlimine, in cases of re-capture, this necessity of bringing into port, condemnation, &c. is asserted to settle the matter between the former owner and the recaptor. So that the salvage paid is different at the will of nations who make regulations obligatory on their own subjects, according to the time the prize had been in the enemy\u2019s possession. These are different in different nations. Vide 2 Wood. 441-443. A neutral subject has nothing to do with them, except he becomes a purchaser; he must then examine into them merely to see what situation he will be in as to his purchase, if it falls into the hands of the nation to whom the former owner is a subject. But how this right of postlimine would operate in such case is not the subject of en-quiry in a neutral court. It has no relation to a dispute between enemy and enemy, and never can operate so as to warrant their carrying on against each other, in a neutral country, a war of suits. But whether a sale be or be not good, is not the present question: it is a capture by one enemy from another, which gives, at least, prima facie, .the right. It is not material now, whether, as some contend, the person making a capture has only a possessory or an absolute right. 2 Burrows, 689. Be this how it may, as to the captor, the former owner is by the capture totally divest-, ed of his property; the captor takes it as a subject of a belligerent nation, and in the first instance for his nation. 2 Wood. 446, 447. The intervention of a court of admiralty of the captor is made necessary, not to give validity to the capture but to inquire into the circumstances. and give the captor his reward by transferring to him the right of the nation, and the court will not vest it in him if the capture is improperly made. This view of the matter shews in a stronger light, that the whole is a national concern. Neutral courts or private individuals, are not clothed with authority to vindicate or cany on national contests; but these disputes must be settled by sovereignties alone. The capture being originally for the nation at war, is national property, and as such, the neutral, anticipating the justice of the belligerent sovereign, whose subject has done the wrong, and at the same time vindicating the rights of its own sovereignty and neutrality, may seize and restore the prize when the neutral territory is invaded in making the capture, if the property is within its power: if not, he may demand restitution and satisfaction from the sovereign of the captors. If this demand is refused, he may obtain what he requires, by reprisals or war \u2014 modes of redress far beyond the reach of judiciary tribunals.\nThe reasoning founded on the supposed illegality of the prize is a petitio principii. For the question is how that is to be ascertained? The discussion about neutral territory is another question, which lies between the sovereign of the captor and that of the neutral nation. Grotius, de Jure B. lib. 3, c. 6, \u00a7 24. The rights of neutrality were not established for the benefit of belligerent parties. They only affect the neutral; and invasion of these rights is an offence to him and not to the party at war. When Cheline who had a commission from the French, then at war with the Dutch, took a ship of the latter near the port of Dublin, the capture was not held piratical, or as to the Dutch unlawful. But it was criminal and unlawful as to the English sovereign, who was a neutral, and the ship was lying under his protection. 2 Wood. 442; Sir L. Jenkins, 754. The party whose property is taken in a neutral country calls on the neutral sovereign to assert these rights, for the protection of those within the territory. If this cannot be done by negociation, it resorts to force, the only law among sovereigns where they differ upon public points. There seems, therefore, no small weight in the objection made to the party libellant. It does not seem proper that a suit, founded on the ground of invasion of neutral territory, should be maintained by a belligerent party. It is even allowed that it would be most conformable to the time point .of the case if the suit was in the name of the United States. What effect this would have I do not determine.\nAs to the Case of Palachi, reported by Bul-strode (3 Bulst. 28), I leave it to be judged of from an inspection of it, and the principles I have before mentioned as prevailing among the civilians in England at that day. My Lord Coke\u2019s statement of it in his 4th Institute does not confine it to criminal proceedings under British statutes (4 Inst. 154). He says that if the Spaniards sue for the property taken civiliter in the admiralty, a prohibition should be granted. And yet in Bul-strode it appears that the prohibition was refused. The civilians and common lawyers of that day, held some opinions not accounted sound at this time. My Lord Coke might have thought that the British laws and statutes alone should be attended to; and that the admiralty had no jurisdiction because the goods were on land, intra corpus comitatus; and the civilians thought otherwise, because the capture was not carried into the enemy\u2019s territory. But both these opinions are now exploded: for the admiralty has cognizance of matters on land if they are incidents to those at sea; and the doctrine of the civilians, as before supposed, is confessed not to be the law of this day. Modern improvements in jurisprudence have abolished many ancient opinions, and- we must act upon the law as it now is; This case of Palachi has been insisted on by both sides, as favourable to their opposite opinions. This, it must be allowed, does not shew its precision and certainty. It is to be presumed (because it is mentioned by Lord Coke in delivering the opinion of the court, or stating the c\u00e1se as Bulstrode has reported it) that Palachi, or Pelagus, being a Jew, and having drowned some Spanish prisoners, had some influence on this case. The Spanish ambassador was a formidable antagonist to the ambassador from Morocco. Gondemar governed King James, and royal influence was not unknown in the courts of justice. Political motives had their .weight, and it was not as well settled then as it now is, that the Moors were to be treated on a footing with other nations. See 2 Wood. 425.\nI do not think the worse of cases in general for their antiquity. But I do not follow them unless I am satisfied with the principles on which they stand. All the cases produced by the libellants, that I recollect, are a century old, and in this period it is singular that none can be produced expressly to their point. Those in Sir Leoline Jenkins do not shew any restitution by sentence of the court of admiralty. There appear to have been many proceedings in that court. One of them in Ireland evidently wrong; and another in which a prize was dismissed for trial in the proper jurisdiction, (Life of Sir L. Jenkins, 733, .727), \u2014 probably the court of the captor. But, by breaking bulk, she came under the notice of the court again, possibly for a breach of fiscal arrangements. In general, all that is to be found in Sir Leoline Jenkins, shews references from the king to him, and reports to the crown in consequence, to aid diplomatic enquiries. This seems to favour, rather than oppose, the opinions of the advocates for the captors in this case. There are a great variety of sentiments and opinions in these extra judicial reports of Sir L. Jenkins, of which I highly approve. Life of Sir L. Jenkins on this subject, passim. But I am not convinced that this court is the proper place to carry them into effect. If the court over which Sir Leoline presided could, in his opinion, have effected the objects of his correspondence with the king, we should have seen decrees and not letters on the subject from him to the crown. His opinion in page 751, is against the doctrine of carrying prizes infra praesidia.\nAs to the opinions in the \u2019\u2018Exposition de Motifs,\u201d it is easy to say. as it is said by one \u2022of the advocates for the libellants, that they do not apply. It is as little difficult to say that they do. The cases on which the dispute originated, it is very true, are different from this. They were those of captures on the high seas, and the neutral ships brought into the ports of the captors, having the property of enemies on board. The commissioners appointed by the - king of Prussia, composed a kind of court of review. But the principles laid down will apply to captures by one enemy from another. This may be seen by a reference to the books in which the exposition is to be found.\nI do not extend these opinions farther, than to captures by one enemy from another. The treaty with Prance (Treaty of Alliance with Prance, \u00a7 17) insisted on by the captors, extends no farther than to such captures. This treaty has its due weight with me; but only in cases evidently comprehended in it. And it appears to me that this case is one of them, so far as judiciary, but not diplomatic examinations are concerned.\nThe idea that part of the sovereignty of this country is given to the judiciary for the purposes here required, is to me new. It should be well weighed before it is agreed to. I have not the same opinion in this point. I consider the judiciary as the expositors of the laws, and not partakers of the' sovereignty for the objects of this suit. Their power is confined to matters of internal police; externally they have no power: they have none of the powers of peace or war. They have no right to command the forces of the country; and these are ,the rrw&ans after negociation fails, by which sovereigns decide their disputes. The courts of England, though they decide freely on all matters of internal police, will not meddle with these rights of the sovereign. 2 Burrows, 765, 766. They will not even grant a habeas corpus in the case of a prisoner of war, because the decision on this question is in another place, being part of the rights of sovereignty. Although our judiei-ary is somewhat differently arranged. I see not, in this respect, that they should not be equally cautious.\n; The position, that in a neutral territory | there is no war, and therefore there can be no legal captures is a good argument if used in the proper place. The reason is, that \u201che who acts against his enemy in the territory of a friend, acts also against the state who governs there.\u201d Lee, 122, 123. It is an of-fence to the neutral state. But still the ques-i tioii recurs \u2014 which is the proper department i of the neutral state to inquire into and vindi-i cate this offence? The weight of this argu- ! ment, though it bears upon the point of out-i rage to the neutral, does not relieve us from I the difficulties attending it. If this court i would assume jurisdiction, and could ascer-i tain our territorial limits and restore the prop- | erty. the outrage would still remain for the i nation to vindicate, if it should think proper. ! Therefore the court could afford but a partial | remedy: and it is best to be settled where the whole can be accomplished.\nThe allegation that the libellants are not calling forth the powers of a prize court, but are seeking redress for a marine trespass, does not comport with the terms of the libel. But it is impossible to enquire into the question of trespass, without involving that of prize or no prize, and so \u201cthe original cause must all come over again.\u201d Doug. 612. The procedure here is in rem, and the object a specific restitution.\ni Damages may be superadded, but a pro- ! ceeding for a marine trespass is different, as | it is entirely a suit for damages, and not for | the thing itself. Neither does this suit for a specific return of the property, appear to be I included in the words of the judiciary act of the United States, giving cognizance to this court of \u201call causes where an alien sues for a tort only, in violation of the laws of nations, or a treaty of the United States.\u201d Judiciary Act, \u00a7 9 [1 Stat. 76]. It cannot be called a suit for a tort only, when the property, as well as damages for the supposed trespass, are sought for.\nA variety of observations were made by the advocates for the libellants, on the general principles of government, the rights of sovereignty and neutrality, and the consequences flowing from an invasion of those rights, just in themselves, but not, in my opinion, necessary for me to determine upon. They will fall very properly under the notice of our government, when the subject is before them. I should very willingly relieve them from part of the burthens thrown upon them by the unhappy contests among other nations; but my views of the powers of this court forbid my interference.\nI do therefore decree, order and adjudge, that the brigantine Fanny, her tackle, apparel, and furniture, and the goods, wares and merchandize, mentioned in the libel, be discharged from arrest, and the libel be dismissed, the plea to the jurisdiction being relevant.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The contract is proved by the testimony of Anderson; and the written paper is merely corroborative. At the time, then, of forming the contract, it was perfectly understood by the parties transacting the business, that Brockholst and J. R. Livingston were jointly concerned ; and, if the action had not been instituted in their joint names, it might have been pleaded in abatement.\nNor is the objection to the variance between the declaration and the written contract, on account of the words \u201c or order,\u201d being stated in the former, though not contained in the latter, material in point of law. It was unnecessary to set forth the written contract at all in the declaration ; and it is only now offered as additional evidence to prove the parol bargain between the parties. In the case of a Bond, Bill of Exchange, or Promissory Note, there would be more weight in the objection; because they are, exclusively, the evidence of the respective contracts to which they give existence, character, and operation ; but the written paper, in the present instance, is of no more force, than any other testimony of its contents would be. The words in the declaration must, therefore, be considered as surplusage, and do not affect the material parts of the charge.\nAs to the Other variances between the contrail as laid, and the Written contrail produced, the fame principles will apply.

Livingston, Esq. the engagement of John Swanwick, Esq. of Philadelphia to deliver to J. R. Livingston, Esq. aforesaid, one hundred shares of the Bank Stock of the United States, on the 5th of January next ensuing, upon receiving from the said John R. Livingston payment for the same, at the rate of twenty-one shillings and six pence in the pound.\n(Signed) SAMUEL ANDERSON.\u201d\nNew-York, 15th July, 1791.\nI. On the trial of the cause, the plaintiffs produced a correspondence between Anderson and the defendant, in relation to the contract, after it was made, and then offered Anderson himself as a witness, to prove that he had received a verbal authority to make the contract, for the defendant ; that he had accordingly executed the instrument, above set forth ; and that there had been a punctual compliance with the stipulations, on the part of the plaintiffs.\nThe defendant objected, that Anderson was not a competent witness to prove his own authority ; and that he was interested in the question, as he had an action actually depending for his commissions on making the contract.\nBut, by the Court :\u2014The witness is competent to prove every part of the transaction. He is not interested in the event of the suit; nor can the verdict, in this case, be given in evidence, upon the trial of the action for his commissions. Anderson was a known, established, Broker ; and unless he was admitted to give evidence of the instructions he received (which were oral in this case, and are usually so, in similar cases) it would be impracticable to ascertain the facts, that are essential to enable the Court to decide upon the merits of the controversy.\nThe witness was, thereupon, admitted.\nII. To the action and declaration (which contained five Counts) the following exceptions were taken, in the course of the defence.\n1st. That the action is brought in the names of Brockholst and J. R. Livingston, whereas the contract in writing is made with J. R. Livingston only.\n2d. That the first Count states an agreement by Swanwick to transfer Stock at a certain day : But the evidence is only of an agreement to deliver an engagement for that purpose.\n3d. That the second and fourth Counts state an agreement by Swanwick, to deliver an engagement to transfer Stock to J. R. Livingston, or order : But the evidence does not prove that he engaged to transfer Stock to the plaintiff's order.\n4th. That the third Count states a contract being made by Anderson, as the authorised agent of Swanwick, that Swanwick should transfer Stock to the plaintiff: But the evidence only shews a contract by Anderson, that there should be delivered to the plaintiff an engagement of Swanwick to transfer the Stock.\n5th. That the fifth Count states the plaintiff\u2019s attendance at the place of transfer ; but there is no proof of the fact.\nBut the exceptions were considered and over-ruled, in the charge to the Jury, of which, in that respect, the following is the substance.\n* The defendant\u2019s counsel tendered a bill ef Exceptions to the ad-mission of Anderson\u2019s testimony; and, also, to the opinion of the Court on the points dated in the charge.

State of Georgia complains, that having a right to the-debt in queftion, that right has been difeufl\u00e9d and over-ruled without giving her an opportunity to be heard.in. fupport of it, though ihe applied to the Circuit Court for that purpofe. It is-another grievance alledged, that a Writ of Error has not been inftituted, when., all the fails appearing upon the Record, the decifion of the Circuit Court might have undergone a full and \u25a0 fitisfaitory revifion, before the tribunal of the laft refort. It is true, that this latter allegation is defe&ively fet forth in the Bill; for, as a Writ of Error could not be fued out without entering fecurityj the State, to entitle herfelf to any benefit from the exception, ought,, in ftriftnefs, to have tendered a fecurity to the defendant in the inferior Court. But ftill, if a writ of error had been brought, it appears to me, that it could only affeft the original Plaintiffs and Defendants in the fuit -, and the State of Georgia could not be made a party to the Record. In this fituation, it niuft, likewife, be conffdered, Georgia had not a conftitutional right to inftitute a fuit, nor could ihe, in my opinion, be admitted as a party to a proceeding in the nature of an Interpleader, in any, but the Supreme Court.\nThe State, however, afferts a claim to the debt in controverfy, by virtue of an A\u00a3i of Confifcation; and the debtor admits that he ought to pay the amount of his bond, but is doubtful to which of the contending parties it ought to be paid. Now, without the equitable interpofition of this court, I think there will be a defeat of juftice ; for it is obvious to me, either that the ftate can have no remedy at law, or at leaft that the remedy at law will not be \u201c plain, adequate, and complete.\u201d Two pofitions have been taken, in oppofition to this opinion: iff. That if the ftate is entitled to the debt, \u2022 Ihe may maintain an aifion on the bond againft the obligors :\u2014Or 2d. That the State might bring an aftion of Ajfumpfit for money had and received, &c againft Brailsford, if Brailsford had no right to recover, or retain it. I will curforily confider botji thefe pofitions.\n1/?. In the firf place, it is to be recollected, that the bond is merged in the judgement; and although the judgement is faid. t\u00f3 be generally binding only on the parties, yet it is good againft ail the world, .until it is reverfed in a regular courfe of law. To any other fuit, for the fame caufe, Spalding might plead the previous judgment in bar ; and the plea could only be defeated by {hewing fraud, or coliufion. There is no pretence, however, for an imputation.of that kind here; fince Spalding fet forth the title of Georgin as fully as the ftate herfelf could have done: And would it not be monftrous, after a judgment rendered under fuch ci'rcumftances, to compel him again to pay the fame debt ? There is neither principle, nor precedent, for fo harfh and oppreflive a doCtrine.\nBut if a fuit could be maintained upon the bond by the ftate, how is ihe to obtain poffeflion of the inftrnment, without the aid-of .a court of eqdity? Suppbfe it has been depofited with the Clerk of the Circuit Court:\u2014that officer cannot deliver it to the ftate, without the judicial mandate of a fdperior Tribunal* Suppofe it remains in the hands of Brailsford.; he can hardly be expected voluntarily, to furnifh his antagonift with the means of combat. In ihort, it is only by the authority of this Court, fitting asa Court \"of Equity, either that the operation of the judgment obtained at common law, againft Spald-ing, can be prevented from becoming conclufive on the queftion of right; or that the State of - Georgia can be enabled to maintain her claim upon its merits.\n2d. It is urged, however, that the State has another remedy at law, by an aclion of AJfumpft for money had and received, againft Brailsford.. This is, indeed, the legal panacea of modern times; and may, perhaps, be beneficially applied to a great variety of cafes. Tut, it cannot be pretended, that this form of adtion will lie, before the defendant has actually re-\u2018 ceived the money, which the plaintiff demands. In the pre-fent inftance, the money has not been received by Brailsford-i and, of courfe, he cannot be compelled to account for it to Georgia.\nThe cafe of Mofes v. M^Farlane, 2 Burr. IOOJ. if at all applicable to-the points now in controverfy, will be found more favorable, I think, to the opinion, which I entertain, than to the opinion, which it has been cited to \u25a0 fupport. From that cafe (which prefents a moft unconfcionable conduit on the part of the defendant) it is to be inferred, as I have already ftated, that a judgment is a perpetual bar, againft a fecond recovery for the fame caufe, unlefs it is tainted with fraud and collufion: But the King's Bench proceed in deciding the queftion then before them on this ground, principally, that the inferior Court, the Court of Confcience, could not take cognizance of the collateral matter, which conftituted' the defence ; -whereas, in the prefent inftance, the matter pleaded by Spalding, was perfeilly within the cognizance and jurifdiition of the Circuit Court.\nFrom this view of the fubject, therefore, I am induced to conclude, that the State of Georgia has no remedy at law ; and, it is fufficient for an incipient exercife of the jurifdiftion of this Court, that fhe has (hewn a color of title to recover the money, and that the money is in danger of being paid to another claimant. I abftain from giving any opinion upon the judgment o'f .the Circuit Court ; but, certainly, I ihould never have con-fented to iffue an-.injunction, if I had thought the legal remedy of the State was plain, adequate, and compleat. If the bill is fuftained, the money will be preferved in neutral hands ; and the Court may dire\u00a3t an iffue to be tried at the bar, in order to afcertain, whether the State of Georgia, or Brailsford, is the right owner.\nBlair, Jufice.\nMy fentiments have coincided, \u2019till this moment, with the fentiments entertained by the majority of the Court; but a doubt has juft occurred, which I think it my \u215b ty to declare.\nI do not conceive, indeed, that any judgment, can be binding upon the rights and intereft.s of a third perfon, who is not a party to the fuit. The very nature of a bill of Interpleader pre-fuppofes, that the party by whom it is exhibited, would be liable a fecond time, if he ihould either voluntarily, or other-wife, pay'the money which he owes, to a wrong claimant. A judgment would not, therefore, in fuch a cafe, be a bar to the aftipn of the claimant, who is legally entitled ; and who might either bring Detinue, o.r Trover, for the bond, againft the pof-feffor of it.5 or if He inftituted an acftion of debt againft the obligor, the Court-might on a proper hearing, order the inftru\u00bb ment to be delivered into his hands.\nPrefuming, then, that there was a remedy at law, I have hitherto thought that there was no ground for the interference of this Court, as a Court of Equity. But, upon reflection, it appears, that if Brailsford, who is a Britijh fubjeCt, ihould get the money,' under the prefent judgment, and leave the country, there would be great danger of a failure of juitice. It was for thisreafon, that the Injunction was originally granted ; and I think the reafon ought to carry us ftill farther. Admitting that Georgia has a complete remedy at law ; her right, though not .'fupported by h\u00e9rfelf, has been ftated to the Circuit Court; and 'though the judgment in that caf\u00e9is rtotbinding upon her, yet, in any future fuit brought by her againft Spalding ', who is bound by the judgment, a limilar difficulty will arile ; for, the Court would then be-called upon to decide, in the abfence of Brailsford (who'coiild not be a party to the common law fuit) upon his claim, as'well as upon the claim of Georgia.\nSince, therefore. there is no other Court, that can bring all the parties before them, and'dogeneral and complete juftice, it is my opinion, that the bill in equity ought to be fuftained ; and that the fubjedt ihould be no further referred to a Court of law, than to obtain an opinion upon the legal title to the debt in controverly.\nJay, Chief Jufice.\nAll the Court, except the Judges who have juft delivered their fentiments, are of opinion, that, if the State of Georgia has, a right to the debt, due originally ,from Spalding to Brailsford, it is a right to be purfued at common law.\n\u25a0 The bill, however, was founded in the higheft equity ; and , the ground of equity for granting an injunction continues the fame\u2014namely, that the money, ought to be kept for the party to whom it belongs. \"We ihall,- therefore, continue the in-jundlion \u2019till the next Term ; when, however, if Georgia has 'nor inftituted.her a \u00bflion, at common law, it will be diffolved.\n*\n* An amicable action .was accordingly entered and tried at the bar of the Supreme Court, in February Term 1794.!

The Word \u201c controverfy\u201d indeed^ would not naturally juftify any fuch conftrudlion, but n ever the-lefs it was perhaps a proper inftance of caution in Congrefs to guard againft\u2019 the poliibiiity of it.\nA general queftion of great importance- here occurs. 'What controverfy of a civil nature can be maintained againft a State by an individual i The framers of the Conftitution, I prefume, muft have meant one of two things : Either r. In the.conveyance of that part of the judicial power which did not relate to the execution of the other authorities of the general Government (which it muft be admitted are full and.difcretionatyj within' the reftri\u00a3tions of the Conftitution itfelf), to refer to antecedent laws for the conftrufldon of the general words they ufe : Or, 2. To enable Congrefs in all fuch cafes to pafs all fuch laws, as they might deem necellary and proper to carry the pur-pofes of this Conftitution into full effe\u00a3l, either aSfolutely at their diferetion, or at leaft in cafes .where- prior laws were deficient for fuch purpofes, if any fuch deficiency exifted.\nThe Attorney-General has indeed fuggefted another cort-ftruction, a conftrucliors, I confefs, that I never heard of before, nor can I now confider it grounded on any folid foundation, though it appeared to me to be the bafts of the Attorne.y-GenefalTs argument. His conftru\u00c9Hon I take to be this :-*\u2022 \u201c That the moment a Supreme Courtis formed, it is to exer-cife all the. judicial'power veiled in it by the Conftitution, by its own authority, whether the Legiflature haG preferibed me\u00bb thods of doing fo, or not.\u201d My conception of the Conftitution is entirely different. I conceive, that all the Courts \u2019 of the , LT-ttHed States muft receive,-not merely their organization as to the number of Judges of which they are to conftft ; but all their authority, as to the manner of their proceeding, from the Legifla-ture only. Ihis appears to me to be one of thofe cafes, with many others, in which an article of the Conftitution cannot be effe\u00f1uated'without the intervention of the Legiflative authority. There being many fuch, at the end of the fpeciat enumeration of the powers of Congrefs in-the Conftitution, is this general-one : \u201c-To make- all laws which \u00edhallbe neceffary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing Powers, and all other powers veiled by this Conftitution in the Government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\u201d None will deny, that an a\u00a3f of Legiflation is neceffayto fay, at leaft of what number the Judges are to conftft; the Prefdent with the eonfent of the Senate could not nominate \u00e1 number at their rtifcreti\u00f3n. The Conftitution intended this article fo far at lead to be the fubjedt of a .Legislative adt. Having a right thus tb eftabliih the Court, and it being,capable of being eft\u00e1bli\u00edhed in no other manner, I conceive it neceffarily follows, -that they are alfo to direct the manner of its. proceedings. Upon this authority, there is, that I know, but one limit; that is, ct that they ihall not exceed their authority.\u201d If theydo, I have no hefitation to fay, that any adt to that effect' Would be utterly void, becaufe it would be inconfiftent with the Constitution, which is a fundamental law paramount to all others, which we are not only bound to. confult, but fworn to obferve.; and, therefore, where there is an interference, being fuperior in obligation to the other, -we muft unqueftionably - obey that in preference. Subjedt to this reftridtion, the whole bufinefs of organizing the .Courts, and diredting, the me thods of their proceeding where neceflary, I conceive to be in the diferetion of Congrefs. If it ihall be found oil this occafion, dr oh any other, that the remedies now in being are defedtive,- for any purpcfe it is their duty to provide for, they.no doubt will provide others. It is their duty to legifate fo far as is neceflary to. carry the Con-ftitution into effedt. It is ottrs only to judge. We have no reason, nor any more right' todiftruft their doing their duty, than they have to diftruft that we all do ours. There is nc part of the Conftitution that I know of,' that authorifes this Court tb take up any bufinefs where they left it, and, in order that the-powers given in the Conflitiitioii may b\u00e9. in. full adtivity, fupply their omiflion by making new laws for new 'cafes ; or, which I take to be fame thing, applying old principles to new cafes materially different from thofe to which they were applied before;\nWith regard to the Attorney-General\u2019s dodtrine of incidents, that was founded' entirely on the fuppofition of the other I have been considering. The authority contended for \u215b certainly not one of thofe neceffarily incident-to all Courts merely as Such.\nIf therefore, this Court is t\u00f3 be (as I consider it), the o.rgati Of the Co>f tint ion and the law, not of the Golifitutim only, ,in refpedt td the manner of its proceeding, we muft \u25a0 receive our diredtions from the Legislature in this particular, ahd have'no right to conftitute ourfelves ah ojfcina brevhm, or take any other fliort method of doing- what the - Conftitution has chofeh (and, in my opinion, with the moft perfedt propriety) Should b\u00e9 done \u2022 ih another mahtter.\nBut the adt of Congrefs has not been altogether filent upon thisfubjedt; The i\u00bf,th feet, of the judicial, adt, provides in the following Words : \u201c All the before mentioned Courts oi the United States, ihall have power to iffue writs of fire facias, ha-beas corpus, and all other writs not-Specially' provided for by Statute, which may be neceftary for the exercife of their refpectiye jurifditUonSj and agreeable to the principles and-ufages of law*. Thefe words refer as well to the Supreme Court as to the o ther Courts of the United States. Whatever writs we iffue, that are neceflary for the exercife of our jurifditSion, muft be agreeable to the principles and ufages of law. \u2022 This is a direction, I apprehend, we cannot fupercede, becaufe it may appear to us not fufficiently extenfive. If it be not, we muft wait till other remedies are provided b.y the fame \u2022 authority. From this it is plain that the Legiilature did not chufe to leave- to our own difcretion the path to juftice, but hasprefcribed one of its own. In doing fo, it has, \u00cd think, wifely, referred us to principles and ufages oFlaw-already well known, and by their pre-cifion calculated to guard againft. that innovating fpirit of Courts of Juftice, which the Attorney-General hi another cafe repro-bated with fo much warmth, and, with whofe fen.timents in that particular, I moft cordially join. The principles of law to 'which reference is to be had, either upon the general ground I firft alluded to, or upon the ipecial words I have above cited, from the judicial aft, I apprehend, can be, either, ift. Thofe ' of the particular law.s of the State, againft which the fuit \u215b brought. Or, 2d. Principles of law common to all the States. I omit any confideration arifing-from the word<c ufages,\u201d tho\u2019 a ftill ftroiiger expreffion. In regard to the principles of the particular laws of th* State of Georgia, if they in any manned differed, fo as to effeft this queftion, from the principles of law, commonto all the States, it might be' m\u00e1terial to enqiiire, whether, there would be any propriety or congruity in laying down a rule of decifion which would induce-this confequence, that an action would lie in the Supreme Court againft Tome States, whofe laws admitted of a compulfory remedy againft their own Governments, -but- hot againft others, wherein' ho fuch remedy Was admitted, or which would require, perhaps, if the principle was received, fifteen different methods o'f proceeding againft States, all {landing in the'fame political relation to the general Government, and none having any .pretence to a diftin&on in its favor, or juftly liable to any di\u00edtin\u00e1ion to its prejudice., if any fuch difference exifted in the laws of tke different States, there would Teem to be \u00e1 propriety, in order* to induce uniformity, (if a Conftitution\u00e1l power for-that pur-- - pofe exifts), that Congrefs \u00edhould preferibe a rule, fitted to this new cafe, to which no equal, uniform, and impartial mode of proceeding could otherwj\u00ede be appliad.\nBut this point, I conceive, it is, utmecefiary to determine, becaufe \u00cd believe there is no doubt that neither in the State now. in queftion, nor in any other in the. Union, any .particular Le-giflative mode, authorifing a'compulforyTuit for the recovery of money againft a State, was in being either when the Conftitu-\u20acon was adopted, or at the time-the judicial adl was paf\u00eded. Since that time an ail of Affembly for fuch a purpofe has. been paf\u00eded in Georgia. But that furely could have no influence in the-eonitruition of an a\u00a3l of the Legiflat-ure of the United States palled before.\n\u25a0 The only principles of law, then, that can be regarded, are thofe common to all the States-. I know of none fuch, \u25a0 which can afieit this cafe, hut thofe -that are derived from what \u215b properly termed <\u00a3 the 'common law,\u201d a Jaw which -I prefume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I confider, fo far as it is applicable to the peculiar cir-cumftances of the country, and where no fpecial a\u00a3t of Legifla-fcion c\u00f3ntrouls it, to be. in force- in' each State, as it exifledin-England, (unaltered by any Jlatute) at the time of the firjl fettlement of the country. The ftatutes of England that are in force \u215b America differ perhaps in all the States ; and, therefore, it is probable the common law in each, is in lome refpects different. But it is certain that in-regard to any commpn law principle which \u00aban influence the queftion before us no. alteration has been made by any flatute, which could occafion the leaft material difference* or-have any partial effect'. No other part of the common law of England, it appears to me, oun' have any reference to this fubjedt, but that part of it which prefcribes remedies; again# the crown;. Every State- in the Union in every inftance where its fovereignty has not been,delegated to the United States, Icorifider to be as coinpleatly foveraign, as the United States are' in re-fpedt to th'e powers furrendered. The' United Stalks are fove-reign as t\u00f3 aH the powers.of Governmenbadlually furrendered-: Each State \u215b- the Union is fovereign as to all.the powers referv-eck.. It muff neceffarily.be. fb, becaufe th\u00bf \u2018United 'Statos have no claim to any authority but- fuch as the States have furrendered to themOf courfe the part not furrenderred mull , remain as.it did before. The powers, of the general Government, either of a Legiflative- .or Executive nature, or- which particularly concerns Treaties with Foreign Powers, do for \u25a0 the moil part (if not-wholly) affecb individuals, and not States-: They require no aid from any State, authority.. This is the gireat leading diiiindlion .between the old articles, of confederation, and the prefentconftitution, The Judicial power is of a peculiar kind.' It is indeed- commenfurate with the ordinary- Legiflative and Executive powers of the general-government,' and the Power which concerns treaties.. But it alfo goes further. Where certain parties are concerned, although the fubjedb \u215b-epntroverfy - does not relate\u2018to any of \u25a0 the fpecial objedts'of authority of the general Government,, wherein the feparate- foyeveigstie\u00bb of the States are blended-in one eommon-mafs of fupre.macy, yet the general Government has a J adicial Authority-\u215b-regar\u00e1 to fuel\u00bb fubje\u00a3ls of controverfy, and the Legiilature of the United States may pafs all laws neceiTary to give fuch Judicial Authority its proper effect. So-far as States under the Conilitution , can be made legally liable to this authority, To far to be fure they are fubordinate to the authority o.f the United States, and their individual fovcveignty is in this refpedi limited. But it is limited no farther than the neceiTary execution of fuch authority requires. The authority ejttei is only-to the decifion of contro-veriies in which a State is a party, and providing Taws neceflary for that purpofe: That furely can refer only to fuch controver-fics in which a State can be a part.; ; in refpeCt to which, if any queition arifes, it can be determined, according to the principles I have fupported, in 110 other manner than by a reference either to pre-exiitent laws, or laws.paffed under the Conilitution and in conformity to it.\nWhatever be the true conilrutSlion of the Conilitution in this particular ; whether it is to be' conftrued as intending merely a transfer of jurifdidtion from one tribunal to another; or as authorifing the Legiilature to pro.vide laws for the decifion of all poffible controverfies in which a State may be.involved with an individual, without regard to any prior exemption; yet it is certain that the Legiilature has in fn\u00a3l proceeded upon the former fuppoiition, and not upon the latter. Tor, befide.s what l no-, ticed before as to an exprefs reference to principles and ufages. of law as the guide of our proceeding, it is obfervable that iu initances like this before the Court, this Court hath a concur-r rent jurifdiclion only ; the prefent being one of thofe cafes where by-the judicial \u215c\u00a31 this Court hath original but not exclttfive ju-. rifdidlioni This Coyrt, therefore, under that a\u00a3t, can cxercife no authority in fuch initance\u00a7, but fuch authority' as from the fubj.ect matter of it .may be exercifed in fome other Court. There are no Courts with which fuch a concurrence can be fug-gefled but the Circuit Courts,. or Courts of tiie different States. Wjth the former it cannot be, for admitting that the Conilitution is'not to have a reftrifitive operation, fo as to confine all cafes in which a State is a party exelufively to the Supreme Court (an opinion to which I am ftrongly inclined), yee there are no. words in the definition of the powers of the Circuit Court which give \u215e colour to an opinion, that where a fuit is brought againft a State by a citizen of another - State,.the Circuit Court could exercife any j.urifdiclion at all, If they could, however, fuch a jurifdiclion, by the very terms of their authority, could be only concurrent' with the Courts of the feveral States. It follows, \u25a0 therefore, unqueflionably, I'think, that looking at the del \u00f3f Congrefs, which I confider is on this occafion the limit t>f our authority (whatever further might be conftitutionaly, \u215c\u215b\u215e\u215c\u215b) yve \u215c\u215e\u215c exercife- no authority in the prefent inftanc e eonfiftently with the .clear intention of\u00bb1 the aft, but fuch as a proper State Court would have been at leaft- comepetent to es> ercife at the time the aft waspafied.\nIf -therefore, no new remedy be provided (as -plainly is the ' cafe), and confequently we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of rhe pre-exiftent laws, which muft remain in-force till fuperceded by others, then it is \u2022 incumbent upon us to enquire, whether previous to the \u25a0 adoption of the Conftitution (which period-, or the period of palling the. law, in refpeft totheobjeft of this enquiry, is perfeftly equal) an-aftion o\u00a3 the nature like this before the Court could have been maintained againft one of the States in the Union upon the principles of the common law, which I have ihewn to b\u00e9 alone applicable. If ft could, 'I think it is now maintainable here : If it could not, I think, as the law ftandskit prefent, it is not maintainable 5 whatever opinion may be-entertained,- upon the conftruftlon of the Conftitution,-as to the power of Congrefs to authorif\u00e9 fuch a one. Now I pr\u00e9fume it will not be denied, that in every State in \u25a0 the Union, previous to the adoption of the Conftitution, the only common law principles in regard to fuits that were in any. manner admiflible in refpeft to claims againft the State, were; thofe which, in England apply to claims againft the crown; there being certainly no' other principles - of the common law which, previous to the adoption of this Conftitution. could, in any manner, or upon any colour, apply to the cafe of a claim agaiiift \u00e1.State in its own Courts, where it wa6 folely and completely fo-vereign in-refpeft to fuch cafes at leaft.. Whether that remedy was ftriftly applicable or not, ftill I apprehend there was no othe.r. The only remedy in a cafe like that before the Court, by \"which, by any poffiblity, .a fuit can be maintained againft' the crown in- England, Or could be at any .period from which the common law, as in force in America, could be derived, I believe \u215b that which is called a Petition of right, It is ftated, indeed, in Com. Dig.' 105. That \u201c until the' time.of Edward I.the King might have been, fued in-all aftions as a common perfon.\u201d And fome authorities are cited for that pofirion, though it is even there ftated as>a doubt. But the fame authority1 adds-r^\u00ab hut now none can have an aftion again ft the King, but one ihall be put to fue to him by petition.\u201d This appears to-be a quotation or .abftraft from Tkeloali\u2019s Digeft, which is alfo one of the authorities quoted in the former cafe. And this book appears (from the law catalogue) to have been printed fo long ago as the year 15.79. The fame doftrine appears (according to a quotation in Blaclf one\u2019s Commentaries, t VoL 243) to be. ftated \u215b pinch\u2019s Law 253, the firft edition of winch, it feems, was publiihed in 1579. -This alfo more fully appears in the cafe of the Bankers} and particularly from the celebrated argument of Somers, in the time\u2019of W. III. for, though that cale was \u215b timately\"decided againft Lord Somers's opinion, yet the ground; on which the decifion was given no way invalidates the rea-foning- of that argument, fo far as it- refpefts the fimple cafe of a fum of money demandable from the King, and not by him-fecured on any particular revenues. The cafe is reported in-Freeman, Vol. I. p., 331. 5 Mod. 29-. Ski mi. 601. and lately very elaborately in a fmall pamphlet publiihed by Mr. Har-grave, which contains all the reports at length, except Skinner\u2019s, together with the argument at large of Lord Somers bebdes-fame additional matter.\nThe fubftance of' the cafe was as follows -.\u2014King Charier II. having received large furas of money from bankers, on the credit of the growing produce of the revenue, for the payment-of .which, tallies and orders of. the Exchequer were given,(after-, wards made transferable by ftatute) and the payment of thefe having been afterward poftporied, the King at length, in order to relieve the Bankers, in 1677, granted annuities to them out-of the hereditary Excife, equal .to 6 per cent intereft on their fe-veral debts, but redeemable on payment of the principal. This intereft was paid \u2019till. .1683, but it then became in arrear\u2019, and' continued fo at the Revolution; and the- fuits which were com-, menced to enforce the payment of thefe arrears, were the fub-je\u00a3k of this cafe. The Bankers prefented a petition to the'Ba-^ rons \u00a9f the Exchequer,. for the payment-, of the arrears of the-annuities granted \u215c to which petition- the Attorney General demurred. Two points were made: F-irft, whether the gfSnt out \u00a9f the Excife- was good'; fecorid, whether a petition to the Barons of the Exchequer was a proper remedy. On'the firft point-the whole Court agreed-, that in general the King could-alienate-the revenues ef the crown ; but Mr. Baron Lechmere. differed from the other Barons, by thinking that this particular, revenue-of the- Excife, was an exception to the general - rule.. Brit all agreed, that the petition was a proper remedy. Judgment was therefore given for the petition by directing payment to the complainants at the receipt of the Exchequer. A writ of Error was brought on this Judgment by the Attorney C\u00eden eral in the Exchequer-Chamber. There all-,the judges who argued held the grant \u2018out of the Excife good. A majority of them, including Lord Chief Juftiee Holt, alfo approved of the remedy by petition to the Barons. But, Lord Chief Juft-ice Treby was of opinion, \u00a1that the Barons qi the -' Exchequer, were not au&orifed to make order- for payments on- the receipt of the Exchequer,, and, therefore, that the remedy by petition to the Barons was inapplicable. In rhis bpinion Lord Somers concurred. A doubt-then arofe, whether the Lord Chancellor and -Lprd High Trea-\u00bb forer were, at liberty to gi$e judgment -according- to their ew\u00bb opinion, in oppofiti\u00f3n to that of a majority of the attendant Judges ; in other words, whether the Judges called .by the Lord Chancellor and Lord High Treafu'rer were to be confidered as mere aiiiftants to them without voices. The opinion of thejudges being taken on this point, feven again ft three held, that the Lord Chancellor and Lord Tireafurer were not concluded by the opinions of the Judges, and therefore that the Lord Keeper in the cafe in queftion, there being then no Lord Treafurer, might give judgment according to his own opinion. Lord Somers concurring in this idea, reverfed the judgment of the Court of Exchequer. But the cafe was afterwards carried by error into Parliament, and there the Lords reverfed the judgment of the' Exchequer-Chamber,' and affirmed that of the Exchequer. However, notwithftanding this final decifion in favour of the Bankers.and their creditors, it appears by,a,fubfequent ftatute, that they were to receive only one,half of their debts ; the 1,\u00be and 14 W. 3, after appropriating certain fums out of the hereditary Excife for public ufes, providing, that in lieu of the annuities granted to die Bankers and all arrears, the hereditary Excife ihould, after, the 26th of December 1601, be charged with annual fums equal to ail inte.reft of three per cent, till redeemed by payment of one moiety of the principal fums. Har-grave s cafe of the Bankers, 1, 2, 3.\nUpon perufing the whole of this cafe, thefe inferences naturally follow :\u2014 1ft. That admitting the authority of that de-cifion in its fulleft extent* yet it is an authority only in refp'ecf to fuch cafes, where letters patent from the crown have been granted for the payment of certain fums out of a particular revenue. 2d. That fuch relief was grantable in the 'Exchequer, \u2022upon no oth\u00e9r principle than that that Court hud a right to-direct the iifues of the Exchequer as well after the money was depofited there as while (in the- Exchequer language) it was in iranfitu. 3d. That fuch an authority could not have beenexer-. ifed by any other Court in WeJlminJler-'Hall, or. by any Court that from its particular conftitution had n\u00f3 conrroul pter the revenues of the Kingdom, Lord C. J. Holt, arid . Lord Somers ;(though they differed in the main point) both agreed in that cafe, that the Court of King\u2019s bench could not Tend a .writ to the Treafury. Hargrave\u2019s -cafe, 45, 89, Coufequently, no fuch remedy, could, finder .\u00e1ny\u2019circumftances, I apprehgyd, be aflowed in any of- the American States; in' none of which it.is preflimed any Court of Juftice hath any exprefs, authority over thc revenues of the State fuch as has been attributed to the Court of Exchequer in England.\nThe obfervations of Lord Somers, concerning the general rc- ' medy by petition to'the King, -have been extracted and deferred to by fome of the ableft law characters. fine?; particularly by Lord C. Baron Comyns in his digeft. I ihall, therefore, 6\u215d\u00bb fome of them, as he appears to have taken uncommon pains to collect all. the material learning on the fubject 5 and indeed is faid to have expended feveral hundred. pounds in the procuring of records relative . to th .t cafe. Hargrave\u2019s preface to the 'cafe of the Bankers.\nAfter citing many authorities, Lord .Somers proceeds thus te By all thefe authorities, and,' by many others, which I could 'cite', both ancient and modern, it is plain, that if the fubjedi tvas to recover a rent, or annuity, or other charge from the crown ; whether it was a rent or annuity, originally granted by the King ; or iffuing out of. lands, which by fubfequent title came to be in the King\u2019s hands '1, in all cafes the remedy to come at it was by -petition to the p.erfon of the King : and no other method can be ihewn to have been pra&ifed at common law. Indeed I take it to be generally true, that in all cafes where the fubjecl is in the nature of a Plaintiff, to recover any thing from the King, his 'only remedy, \u00e1t common law, is' to fue by Petition to the' perfon of the King*. I fay, where the fubjedt comes as a Plaintiff. For, as I faid before, when, upon a title .found for the King by office, the fubjedt comes in to'-traverfe the King\u2019s title; or to ihew hrs own right, he comes in the na-1 ture of a Defendant \u215d and is admitted to interplead in the cafe \u2022with the King in defence of his title, which otherwife would be defeated by finding the office. And to fhewdhat this was fo, I would take notice of feveral inftane'es. That, in cafes of debts owjng by-the crown, the. fubjedt\u2019s remedy1 was by Petition, appears by Aynejhanis cafe; Ryley,. 251. which, is a petition for \u00bf19. due for work done at Carnarvon caftle. So Ryley 251. The executors of John Efirateling petition for \u00a3 132. due to the . teftator fop wages. ' The arifwer is remarkable ; for there fe a' latitude taken, which will very well agree with the notion that fe taken up in this cafe; Habeant bre. de liberate in Cane. thef. itf earnerar. defin\u00ed. in partem folutionis.

The anfwer is, Rex erd'mavit per concilium thefaurarii iff baronum de feas cario, quod fatisfiet iis quam citius fieri poterit \u00a1, ita quod c\u00f3nter.\u00bb tos f\u00e9tenebunt. And this is an anfwer - given to a petition - pre-fen ted to .the King in Parliament;' and therefore we havereafon to- conclude it to be warranted by law. \u25a0 They muft be content, apd they ihall be paid,'quam\\ citius-fieri potefit. 1 The\u2019 parties, \u25a0\u215b thefe; cafes, firlt go to the King'\u25a0 by petition-: it is by him \u215beyj- \u00e1re fent to the ' Exchequer \u215b. and it'is by writ under the: great feql, that, the Exchequer is knpotVered to adt. Nor cart *ny fuch writ he found (unlefs in a very few inftatic\u00e9s, where it is mere matter of account) in which' the Treafurc.r is not joined with the Barons. \u2018So fat was ft from heitlg taken to be law at that time, that the B\u00e1roits had any original power of paying the Kitig\u2019s debts \u00be Or Of commanding annuities, granted by the King.or his progenitors, to he paid, When the per^ fon applied to them for'ftich payment. But perhaps it may be -objected, that i\u2019t is not to be inferred, becaufe petitions were brought- in thefe cafes, that therefore it was of necefiity that the fubjerit ihoukl purftte that c'ourfe, and could take no. other way. It might be reafortable to. require from thofe who obj-edfc thus, that they fhould produce feme precedente at leaft, of another remedy taken. ' But I think there is a good \u00e1nfwer to he given to this obje&ion. All thefe petitions which I hav\u00e9 mentioned, aVe after the St at. 8 Ed. I.

As fo all others' I confider the authorities on which he relied, and his de-\u25a0dudlion from them, to be unimpeached.\nBlachflone, in the firft volume , of his commentaries (p. 203), fpeaking of demands in point of property, upon the King, ftates the general' remedy thus :\u2014If any p\u00e9rfon has,'in point .of property, a'juft demand upon the King, he muff petition him in his'Court of Chancery, where his Chancellor will adminif-ter right, asa matter of grace, though not-upon^compulfion. (For which he cites Finch L. 255.). \u201c And this is exadtly con-donan t to what is laid down by the writers on. natural law\u2014 A fubjedt, fay PuffendorJ, .1|> long \u00aba he continues a fubjedt, hath no way to oblige his Prince to give him his due when he refufes, it 5 though no wife Prince will ever refufe to Hand to a lawful contradi. And if the Prince gives the fubjedt kiave to- enter an adtion againft him upon fuch contradi, in his own Courts, the adtion. itfelf proceeds rather upon natural equity, than upon the)municipal laws. For the end of fuch adtion is not to compel the Prince to obferve die contradi, but to purjuade him.\u201d\nIt appears, that when \u00e1 petition to the perfpp of the King is properly prefented, the uf\u00fcal way is for the King to indorfe or underwrite, foit droit fait\u2019 al partie, (let right .be.done to the party); upon which, unlefs the Attorney-General confeffes the-luggeffion,a commiffion is iffued to enquire into the truth of it t after the .return of which, the King\u2019s attorney is at liberty to plead In bar, and the merits ihall be determined upon i\u00edT\u00fae or demurrer, as in fuits between fubjecl and fubjecl. If the,Attorney-Gfeneral confdies tb\u00b0. fuggeftion there is ho occafion for a commiffion, his admiffion of the truth of the facts being equally conclufive as if they had been found by a jury.\u2014See 3 Black-fiends Commentaries 256. and 4 -Com. Dig. 458.. and the authorities there cited. Though the above mentioned indorfe-' tnent be the ufual one, Lord Somers, in the courfe of his. voluminous fearch, difcovered a variety \u00a9f other anfwers to what he confidered were unqueftionable petitions of right; in refpect to which he obferves : \u201c The truth is, the manner of anfwer-ing petitions to the perfon of the King was yery various;-which variety did fometimes arife from the conclufion of the party's petition : fometimes from the nature of the thing ; and fome-times from favour to the perfon ; and according as the indorfement was, the party was lent into Chancery, or the other Courts. If the indorfement was general, foit droit fait al partie, it mult be delivered to the Chancellor of England, and then a-commif-fion was to go tq find -the right p\u00a3 the party ; and that being found, fo that there was a record fo Aim, thus warranted, he is let in to interplead with the King : but if. the indorfement was fpecial, then the proceeding was to be according, to the indorfement in any other Court. This is. fully explained by Stamford, (StaundfortJ. in his treatife of the Prerog. c. 21. The cafe Mich, xo H. 4. 4. no.- '8. is full as to this-matter. The King recovers in a fihiare impedit by default againil one who was never fummoned.j the pa,r,ty cannot have a writ of deceit, without a petition. If then, fays the book, he concludes his petition' generally \u00ab que le Roy \u00a1ui face droit\u201d (that the King will cauie right to be done)- and the anfwer be general, it mull go into the Chancery, that, the right may inquired of by commiffion \\ and, upon the inquetl found, an original writ muftbe dlre\u00a3led to the j uftices to examine the deceit othenvife, the Juftices, benre whom the fuit was, cannot meddle : But if he conclude his -oetition efpecially,. that it may pleafe his Uigbiefs to command-b.is. Jufiices. to., proceed to. the examination, and the indorfement be accordingly, that-had given the Juftices a jurifdiclion. They might in fuch cafe have proceeded upon the petition without any commiffipn, or any writ to be fued out; the petition and anlwer indorfed giving afufficient juiifdiftion to the Court to-which it was directed. And,as the book I have mentioned, proves this, fo many, other authorities \u2019may be cited.\u201d lie accordingly mentions many other mftances, Immaterial to be recat-eo here, particularly remarking a very extraordinary difference irt \u25a0the cafe belonging to the revenue, in regard to which he laid,, be thought there was not an inftance to be found where peti-\u00be\u215b\u215d\u215c were anfwcred, fit droit, fait aux parties (let right be done to the parties): The ufual reference appears to have been to ,&*. Treafurer' and Barons, commanding them to do juftice : Sometimes a writ under the great feal was directed to\u2019- be iffued to. them for that purpofe :' Sometimes a writ from the Chancery dir\u00e9\u00f1ing payment' <sf Aoney immediately, witliout taking notice of the Barons. And other, varieties appear to. have taken plaCe'. See Hargrave's safe- of the- Rankers, p. 73, is\u2019feq. But in all cafqs of petition of right, of 'whatever nature is the demand, \u2022 I think it is clear b'eyojid all doubt, that there. mujl he fame indorfement or order of the King hitrfelf to warrant any further proceedings. The remedy, in the language of Blachjlone, 'being a matter of grace, atld not on. comp\u00fclftan.\nIn a very \u215b\u215b'cafe in England, this point was incidentally difeuffed. The cafe I refer to, is the cafe of Macbeath againft Haldimatt4, reported- if - Dun ford \u215b*1 Eajl 172.'- The afftion Vas againft the'Defendant, for goods ft\u00edmi\u00edhed by the Defendant\u2019s order in Canada., wh\u00e9\u00bb the Defendant was Governor of' Quebec. The defence Was, that the Plaintiff was employed by the Defendant in his official capacity, and not \u00fap on, his perfonal. credit, and that $he goods being therefore furnifnedfor-the ufe of. Governm.enf;, arid the Defendant not having undertaken personally to 'pay; he was not lfeble,. This defence, Was fet up at the trial, on the-plea of the general iffa\u00e9, and the Jury, by Ju,dgfe Buller\u2019s direction, found a verdwft for the Defendant. Ugon a motion fei anew trial he reported particularly all the faifts\u2019given.iri evidence, and faidhis opinion had been at.the trial that the Plaintiff fhould be nbmfuited i \u2018i but the Plaintiff\u2019s counfel appearing-for their client-, when 'he was, called, he left the queftibri. to the'jury, telling them that they were bound to find for the- Defendant in point of law,. And upon t-heir a iking him .whether, in the event of the Defendant not being liable, any other perfon was, he told them,- that was no part of their con finer at ion, But being willing to give them any information, he added, that be-was of opinion, that if the Plaintiff\u2019s demands were- juft, his proper remedy Was by a Petition iff right to the crpwn. On which' they found a verdidl for the Defendant,, The rule for-granting- a new trial was moved \"for, on the mifdire&ion of - two. points. 1 ft. That the Defendant had by his own condufit made himfelf liable, which queftion fhould have been left to the jury. 2dly. That the Plaintiff had no remedy againft th'\u00e9 crown by a .Petition of right, on the fuppbfition of which the Jury had been induced to give their verdift.\u201d- \u201c Lord Mansfield, Chief Juftice, now declared', that the Court did not feel it neceffary for them to give any opinion on the fecond ground. His Lordihip faid that great difference had arifen fince the revolution with re-fpe\u00a3l tp the expenditure of the public money-.' Before that period, aft the public fupplieS were' given to. the King, -who in |ifs individual capacity contradled for all expences. He alone Jiad the difpofition of the public money. But fincethat t\u00edme the fupplies hi d been appropr\u00ed\u00e1ted by Parliament to particular purpofes,' and now* whoever advances money for the public fervice trufes to the farth of Parliament. That according to the tenor of Lord Somers\u2019s argument in the Bankers cafe, though a Petition of right would lie, yet it would probably produce no effedl. No benefit was ever derived from it in the Bankers cafe and Parliament was afterwards obliged to provide a particular fund for the payment \u00f3f thofe debts. Whether, however, this alteration in the mode o f-diftributing the fupplies had made ' any difference in the law upon this fubjedl, it was unneceifary to determine. '; at any rate, if there were a;recovery againft the crown, application muft he made to,Parliament, arid it would corpe under the head of fupplies for the year.? The motion was afterwards argued op the other ground (with which I have at prefent nothing to do) and rejedled\u00bb\nIn the old authorities, there doe's not appear any diftindlion, between debts that might be contradled perfonally by the- King, for his own private ufe, and fuch as he contradled in his political capacity for the fervice of the kingdom. As he had however then fixed and independent revenue's, upon which depended the ordinary fupport of Government, as well as the expenditure for his own private occafions, probably no material diftindlion at that time exifted, or could eafily be made. A very - important-diftindlion may however perhaps now fubfift between the'two cafes, for the teafons intimated by Lord Mansfield ; fince the whole fupport of Government depends now on Parliamentary provifions, and, except in the cafe of the civil lift, thofe for the raoft part annual. \u2022\nThus, it appears, that in England even in cafe of a private debt contradled by the King, in his own perfon, there is no remedy but by - petition, .which muft receive his exprefs fandtion, other-wife there can be no proceeding upon it. If die debt contradl-ed be avowedly for the pub\u00fcc ufes of Government, it is at lead doubtful whether that remedy will lie, and if it will, it remains afterwards in the power of.Parliament to provide for it or not among the current fupplies of the year.\nNow let us-confider the cafe of a debt due from a State; None can, I apprehend, bfe diredlly,claimed but in the following inftances. lit. In cafe of a Contradi with- the Legifiature it-' felf. 2d. In. cafe of a contradi with the Executive, or any other perfon, in confequencepf an exprefs authority from the Legif-laturej 3d. In cafe of a contradi with the Executive without any fpecnll authority. In thefiifi. andfecond cafes, the contradi is evidently made on the public, faith alone. Every man muft 4now that noTuit dan .lie againft a Ldgiflative body. His,only dependence, therefore can be, that'the Legiflature on principJe& of public duty, will make a provifion for the execution of their-own contrails, and if that fails, whatever reproach the Legifla-ture may incur, the cafe is certainly without remedy in any o\u00a3 the Court a of the State. It never was pretended, evert in the cafe of the crown in England\u00bb that if any contradi; was made with Parliament, or with the crown by virtue of an authority from Parliament, that a Petition to the crown would in fuch cafe lie. In the third cafe, a contradi with the Governor of a State without any fpecial authority. This cafe is entirely different from fuch a contradi made with the crown in England. The. crown there has very high prerogatives, in many inilances is a. kind of truftee for the public interdi, in all cafes,' reprefents the fovereignty of the Kingdom, and\u25a0 is the only authority \u2022which can-fue j>r be fued in any mannerron behalf of the Kingdom in any Court\u2022 'of JuJliee. A Governor of a State is a mere Executive officer;, his general authority very narrowly limited by the Conflitution of the State \u215c with' no undefined or difputabte prerogatives without power to effect one finding of the public money, but as he is authorifed under the Conftitution, or by a particular law having no colour to reprefent the fovereignty of the State, fo as to bind it in any manner to its prejudice, unlefs fpecially autho-rifed' thereto. \u25a0 And therefore all who contradi with him do it at their own peril, and, are bound to fee (or take the confe-quence of their own indifcretion) that he has Uriel authority for any contradi' he makes. Of courfe fuch contradi when fo authorifed will come within the defeription I mentioned of cafes where public faith alone is the ground of relief, and the Le~. \"illative body the only one that can afford a remedy, which fro-m the very nature of it mull be the effedt of its diferetion, and' not of any coinpulfory procefs. If however any fuch cafes were iimilar toriiofe which would entitle a party fo relief by-\u2022petition to the'King in England, that Petition being only preventable to him as he is the fovereign of the Kingdomy fo. far as analogy is to take place, fuch Petition in a State could only. be prefented to the fovereign power, which furely the, Governor is not. The only conliituted authority to which.fuch an application, could with any propriety be made, muil undoubtedly be the Legiflature, wbofe exprefs. content, upon the principle of analogy, would be neeeflary to any further proceeding. So that this bring\u00fc us (though by a different route)- to the fame-goal ; Cfhc dijer\u2019etion and good faith of the Legijlative body.\nThere \u2022 is no other part of- the common law, befidts that which I have eonfktered, which cnnby.any.perfon be pretended, in any manner to apply to this cafe, but that which concerns, corporations. \u2019.The applicability of this, the Attorney-General, with great candour, has cxprefsly waved. Rutas it may be utged-on other occafions, and as I wiih to give the fulleft fa-tisfadlion, I will fay a few words to that dodtrine. Suppofe, therefore^ it-ihould be objedied, that the re\u00e1foning I have now \u00abfed is not conclufive, becaufe, inafmuch as a State is made fubjedl .t\u00f3 the judicial power of Congrefs, its fcvereignty mail not ftand in the,way of the proper exercife of that power, . and, therefore, in all fuch cafes (though in no other) a State can only be confidered as a fubordinate corpdrntion merely. \u00a3 anfwer,:' ill. That this conftrudlion can only be allowed, at the utriioft, upon the fuppofition that the judicial authority of the United States, as it refpedls States, cannot be effedluaced, without proceeding againft them in that light: a pofition I\u2019-by \u25a0 ;no means admit. 2d* \"That according to the principles I have \u25a0\u00edupport\u00e9d in this argument, admitting that States ought tobe fo confidered for that purpo\u00ed\u00e9, an adl of .the Legiflature is ne* cefiary to give effedt to fuch a conftrudlion, unlefs the old doctrine concerning corporations will naturally apply to this particular cafe. gtf. That as it is evident the add of Congrefs has not made any-fpecial provifion in this cafe, grounded on any \"-ch conftrudlion, fo it is to my'- mind perfectly clear that we have . no authority,. upon any fuppofed analogy between the two cafes, to apply the. common dodtrine concerning \u25a0 corporations* to the important cafe now before the Court. I take it for granted, \u2022 that when any part of an antient law is to. be applied to a new cafe the' circumftanCes of- the new cafe mail agree in all effential points with the circumftancep of the old cafes to which -that antient law was formerly appropriated. \u00cdSTow there are, in my opinion, the moil effential differences between the old cafesof corporations to which the law intimated has reference, and the great and extraordinary cafe of States feparately poffefling, as to every thing limply relating to themfelves, the fulleft powers of fovereignty, and yet in fome .other defined particulars fubjedfc to a fuperior power compofed out of themfelves for the common welfare of the whole. The only law Concerning corporations, to which! conceive the lead reference is to be had, is the common law of England on that fubjedl. I need not repeat the obfervations I made in refpedfc to the operation Of that law in this country. The word \u201c corporations,\u201d in its largeft fenfe, - has a more extenfive meaning than people generally ar.e \u2022 aware of. Any body politic (foie or aggregate) whether its power be reftridfced or tranfeendsmt, is in this fenfe \u201c a corporation.\u201d The King, accordingly, in England is called a corporation, id \u25a0 Co. 29. b. So alio* by a very refpedlable.author (Sheppard, hi his abridgement, 1 Vol. 431.J is the Parliament itfelf. In this extenfive fenfe, not only each State fingly, \u00abbut even the United States razy without impropriety be termed \u201c corporations.\u201d \u25a0 f have* therefore, in .contradiftindlion to this large and indefinite term, ufed th\u00e9 term \u00ab fubordinate corporations,\u201d meaning ft* referi\u00f3 fuch only (as alone capable of the flighted application, for the purpofe of the objection) whofe creation and whofe powers-are limited by law.\nThe differences between fuch corporations, and the fevera! States in the' -Union, as relative to the general Government, ate Very obvious' in the following particulars, ift. A corporation is a mere creature of the King, or of .Parliament 5 very rarely of the latter; moft ufually of the former only-. It owes its exiftence, its name, and its laws, (except fuch laws as are neceffarily incident to all corporations merely as fuch) to the Authority which create'it\u00bb A State does-not owe its origin to the Govtrnment of the' United States, in the higheft or in any of its branches. It was in exiftence before it. It derives its authority from the fame pure and' facred fource as itfelf: The voluntary and deliberate choice of the people, 2d, A corporation can do no a\u00a3t but what is fubjeft to the revifion either of a Court of Juftice, or of fome other authority within the Government. A State is, altogether exempt from the jurifdidHon of the Courts of the United States, or from any other exterior authority, unlefs in the fpecial inftances where the general Government has power derived from the Conftitution itfelf.- 3d. A corporation i;s -altogether dependant on that Government t\u00f3 which it owes its exiftence. Its charter may be forfeited by \u00e1bufe. Its: authority may be annihilated, without abufe, by an act of the Legifl\u00e1t\u00edye body. A State, though fubjeft in certain fpecifted particulars to the authority of the Government of the United States, is in every other rfefpedt totally independent upon it. The people of the State ' Created, the people of the State can only change, its Conftitution\u00bb \u25a0 Upon this power there is no other limitation but that impofed by the Conftitution ol the United States ; tkat 'it mtijl be of the Republican form. I omit minuter diftindtions. Thefe are fo palpable, that I never can admit that a fyftem of law calculated for one of thefe cafes is to be appllied, as a matter of courfi,- to the other, without admitting (as I conceive) that the diftindft boundaries of law and Legiflation1 may be confounded, in a manner that would' make Courts arbitrary, \u2018And in effedi makers of a new law, inftead of being (as certainly they alone ought to be) expoftors of an ex~ ifinjr bne..

That the Conftitution, fo far as it refpe\u00e9fs the.-judicial an* thority, can only he carried into e\u00edFe\u00e9t by ait's of the Regiflature. appointing Courts, and prefqribing their :tnethods of proceed--ing. 2d. That Congref, has provided no new.lew in tegarci ta this cafe, hut exprefaly referred as to -the old.. 3 2, That there ar\u00e9 no principles of ..the old law, to which we mu ft have irecourfe, that in any Planner aitthorife the- .prefent lhiV either by precedent or by analogy. The confequenee of .which, in my \u00abpinion,\" clearly is, that the fuit in queftion cannot- be main* tained, nor, of courfe, the motion \"made upon it be complied with.\nFrom.- the manner in which I have viewed -tbisdubjeft,. fo different from that in which it has been contemplated by the Attorney General, it is evident, that,I have- not had, occafion-to notice many arguments offered by the, Attorney General, which certainly were very proper, as to' his extended view of the cafe, but do not affecft mine. No part of -- the Raw of Nations can apply to this cafe, as.,1 apprehend, .but- that part which is. termed \u201c The Conventional Law :of Nations \u215c\u201d nor can this-any otherwife apply than as funaiihing rules of - interpreta* tion,- fincc unqueftionably the people of the United States had a right to form what kind of union, and upon what terms they pleafed, without reference to any former examples. If upon a fair conftru\u00a3tion of the Conftitution of the United States, the power contended for really exifts, it undoubtedly may b\u00e9 ex* ercifed, though it be a power of the firft impreffion. If \u215b' does not exift, upon that authority, ten thoufand examples of fimilar powers would not warrant ies affhwptign. So far as this great queftion affedls the Conftitution itfelf, if the .prefent afforded, confiftently with the particular grounds of my \u00bfpinion, a .proper occafion for a decifion upon it, I would \u25a0 not ihrink from its difeuffion. But it is of extreme moment that no Judge ftiould raihly commit himf\u00e9lf upon important queftions, which it is unneceffary for him to decide. \u2022 \u2018My opinion being, that even if the Conftitution would admit of ..the exercife of fuch a power, a new law is neceifary for the purpofe, fince no part of the exifting law applies, this alone is fufficient to juf* tify my determination in the prefent cafe. So much, however, has been faid on, the Conftitution, that it may not be improper to intimate that my prefent opinion is.ftrongly againfi any con-ftru&ion of it, which will admit, under any circumftances. * compulfive fait againfi a State for the recovery of 'money. R think every word in the Conftitution may have its full effedl without! nvolving this confequence, and that' nothing but ex-prefs words, or an infurmountable implication (neither of which I'confider, can be found in this .cafe) would authorife the de-duftion of fo high a power. This opinion I hold, however^ with alijthe referve proper for one, which, according to my fen. t,iments in this cafe,. may be deemed in fom\u00e9 meafure extra-judicial. With regard to the policy of maintaining fuch fuits, that is not for this Court to coniider, unlefs the point in all otlier re-fpecfts was very doubtful. Policy might then be argued from with a view to preponderate the judgment. Upon the queftion before us, I have no doubt. I have therefore nothing to do with the policy. But I confefs, if I was at liberty to fpeak on that fubjedl, my opinion on the policy of . the cafe would alfo differ from that of the Attorney General. It is, however, a \u25a0delicate topic. I pray to God, that if the Attorney General\u2019s do&rine, as to the law, be eftabliihed by the judgment of this Court, all the good he predifts from it- may take place, and none of the evils with' which, I' have the concern to fay, it--appears to me to be pregnant.\nBlair, Jujlice. In confidering this important cafe, I have thought it belt to pafs over all the ftriftures which have been made on the various European confederations ; becaufe, as, on the one hand, their likenefs to our-own is not fufficiently clofs to juftify any analogical application ; fo, on the' other, they are' utterly deftitute of any binding authority here. The Confti-tution of t(ie United States is the only fountain from which.I lhall draw; the only authority to which I fhall appeal. Whatever be the true language of that, it is obligatory upon every member of the Union ; for, no State could have become a member, but by an adoption of it by the people of that State. .What then do-we find there. requiring the fubmiffion of individual States to the judicial authority* of the United States ? This is \u00e9xpr\u00e9fsly extended, among other things, to controverfies between a State and citizens of another State. Is then the cafe before us one of that defcription ? Undoubtedly it is, unlefs it may be a fufficient denial to fay, that it is a \u25a0 c\u00f3ntroverfy between a citizen of one State and another State. Can this change of order be an effential change in the thing intended ? And is this' alone a fufficient ground from which to conclude, that the jurifdiSion of this Court reaches, the cafe where a State. is Plaintiff\u2019, but not where it is Defendant ? In this latter cafe, ihould any man be afked, \"whether it -was not a cpn-troverfy- between a State and citizen of another State, muft not anfwer be in the affirmative ? A difpute between A. and B. \u2022sturdy a difpute between B. and A. Both cafes, I havens doubt,, were intended ; and probably the State was firil named, in refpeft to the dignity of a State. But that.very dignity feems to have been thought a fufhcient reafoii for confining the fenfe to the cafe where a State is plaintiff. It .is, however,. a fuffi-cient anfwer to fay, that our Conftitution 'moil certainly contemplates,in another banch of, the cafes enumerated, the maintaining a jurifdiftion againft a State, \u00e1s Defendant; this is unequivocally afferted when the judicial power of the United States is extended to controverfies between two or more States ; for there, a State m\u00faft, of necefiity, be a Defendant. It is extended alfo, to controverfies between a State and foreign States ; and if the argument taken from the order of defignation were good, it would be meant here, that this Court might have cognizance of a fuit, where \u215b State is Plaintiff, and. feme foreign State a Defendant, but not where a foreign State brings a fuit againft a State. This, however, not to mention that, the in-ftances may rarely occur, when a State may have an opportunity of fuing in the American Courts a foreign State; feemS to lofe fight of the policy which, no doubt, fuggefted this provi-fion, viz. That no State in the Union ihould, by withholding juftice, have it in its power to embroil the-Whole confederacy in difputesof another nature. But if a foreign State, though laft named, may, neverthelefs, be a Plaintiff againft an individual State, how can it be faid, that a controverfy between a State and a citjzen of another State means, ,from thfe mere force of the order of the words, only fuch cafes .where a State is Plaintiff? After defcribing, generally, the judicial' powers of the United States, the Conftitution goes on to fpeak of it diftribu-tively, and gives to the, Supreme Court original jurifdiftion, among other inftances, in the cafe where a State {hall be a party; but is not' a State a party as well in the. condition of a Defeii-\u2019dant as in that of a Plaintiff ? -And is the whole force of that expreffion fatisfie'd by confining its meaning to the cafe of a Plaintiff-State ? . It feems to me, that if this Court fhould, re-fufe to .hold jurifdiftion of a cafe where a.State is. Defendant, it would renounce part of the authority conferred, and, confe-quently,. partof the duty impofed. on it-by the Conftitution 5, becaufe it would be a refufal to take cognizance of a cafe where\u2019 a State is a party. Nor does the jurifdiftion of this Court, in relation to a State, feem to me to be queftionable, on the. ground that Congrefs has not provided any form of execution, or pointed out any mode of making the judgment againft a State, effeftual; the argument ab' in uiili may weigh much in. cafes depending upon the conftruftion of doubtful Legiilative afts, hut can have no force,; I, think, againft the clear and pofi-tive directions of lan aft of Congrejs\u25a0 and of the Conftitution. Let us go on as'far asi we can ; and if, at the .end of the bu\u00bb fin\u00e9is, notwithftanding.tlie. powers given us in' the-\u201914th feftion of the judicial law, we meet difficulties- infurmountable t<9 -uS, tve muft-leave it to thofe 'departments- of Government which \"\u00bfhave higher pow.ers ; to which, however* there may be no ne-ceffity to have recourfe : Is it altogether a vainexpefiatioft, that a State may have other motives than fuch as arife from the ap-prehenfion of coercion, to carry into execution- 'a judgment of .the Supreme Court of the United States, though not- conformable to their own .ideas of jufticef Bell des, this argument takes it for granted, that the judgment of the Court will be 'againft the State 5 it poifibly5- may be \u215b favor of the State ; and the difficulty vaniffies. Should judgment be given againft- the Plaintiff, could it be faid to be void, beeaufe extra-judicial ? If the Plaintiff grounding himfelf upon that notion, feould renew his fuit againft the State, in any mode in which fee may permitherfelf tobe feed in her own Courts, would the Attor-. n\u00e9y General for the State be obliged to go again into the merits of the-Cafe, beeaufe the matter, when here, was coram non ju-dies ? Might he not rely ujfen \u2022 the judgment given by this. Court in-bar of the new luit? Tome it feems-clear that he might. And if a State may be brought before this Court, as at Defendant, I lee no reafon fot confining the Plaintiff to- proceed by way of .petition -, indeed there would even feerrt to be an-impropriety in proceeding in that mode. When fovereigns are feed in their own Courts, fech--a method may have-been ef-tablifeed as the moft refpeftful form of demand ; but we are trot now in a State-Court % and if fovereignty be an exemption from fuit in any other than the fovereign\u2019s own Courts, it follows that when a State, by adopting the Conftitutioh, has agreed to be amenable to the judicial power of the United States,' fee has, in that refpeef, givenr-up her right of fovereignty.\nWith refpetl to-the fervic\u00e9 of .the femmons to appear, the manner in which it has been ferved feems to be as proper as any which could be devifed for the purpofe of giving notice of the fuit, which is the end propofed by it, the Governor being the head of the Executive Department, and the Attorney General the law-officer, who generally reprefents the State in legal proceedings : And this mode is the lefs liable to exception, when it is confidered, that- in the fuit brought in this Court by the State of Georgia againft Brailsford\n*\nand others, it is conceived in the name of the Governor in behalf of the State. If the opinion which-I have delivered, refpe&ing the liability of aStatetobe feed in -this Court, feould be the opinion of the Court, - it will come in courfe to confider, what is the proper, ftep to be taken for inducing appearance, none having, been y\u00e9t entered in behalf \u25a0of the Defendant. A judgment' by default, in the prefent ftage of the bufinefs,- and writ of enquiry of damages, would be too precipitate in arty cafe, and too incompatible with the dignity of a State in this. Farther opportunity of appearing to defend the fait ought to be given. The conditional order moved for the laft term, the confideration of which was deferred to this* feems to me to be. a very proper mode;, it will warn the State of the meditated confequence of a refufal to appear, and give an opportunity for more deliberate 'confideration. The order, I think, ihould be thus: \u2018 Ordered, that c unlfefs the State 'of Georgia ihould, after due notice' of this \u2018 order, by a fervice thereof upon-the Governor and Attorney * General of the faid State, caufe an appearance to be entered i in behalf of the State, on the 5th day of the next Term, or * then ihew caufe to the contrary, judgment be,then entered up 4 againft the State, and a writ of enquiry of damages be * awarded.\u2019\nWilson, JuJlice.\nThis is a cafe of uncommon magnitude. \u00a3>ne of the parties to it is a State; certainly refpe&able, claiming to be fovereign. The queftion to be determined is, whether this State, fo refpe\u00bftable, and whofe claim foars fo high* is amenable to the jurifdi&ion of the Supreme Court of th\u00e9 United States ? This \u25a0 queftion, important in itfelf, will depend on others, more important ftill; and. may, perhaps, be ultimately refolved into one, no left radical than this\u2014\u201c do the people of the United States form a Nation\nA caufe fo confpicuous and interefting, Ihould be carefully and accurately viewed from every poffible point of fight; I ihall examine it; ijl. By the principles of general jurifprudence. id. By the laws and pra\u00e9Hce of particular States and kingdoms. From- the law of nations little or no illuftration of this fabje\u00a3t cap be expected. Bythatlawthe feveral States and Governments fpread over' our globe, are confidered as forming a fociety, not u nation. It has only been by a very few comprehenfive minds, fuch as thofe of Elizabeth and the Fourth Henry, that this laft great idea has been even contemplated. 3dly. and chiefly, I fhall examine the important queition before us, by the Conftituion of the United States, and the legitimate refult of that valuable inftrument.\nI. I am, firft, to examine this queftion by the principles of. general jurifprudence. What \u00cd ihall fay upon this head, I introduce by the obiervation of an original and profound writer, who, in the philofophy of wind, and all the fcienCes attendant on this prime one, has formed an sera not lefs remarkable, and far more illuftrious, than that formed by tha juftly celebrated Bacon, in another fcience, not profecuted with lefs ability, but lefs dignified as to its. object ; I mean the philofophy of matter. Dr. Reid, in his excellent enquiry into the human mind, on the principles of common fenfe, fpeaking of the fceptical and illiberal philofophy, which under bold, but falfe, pretentions. t\u00ab prevailed in many parts of Europe before he wrote, makes the following judicious remark : \u201c.The language of philo--ibphers, with regara to the original \u25a0 faculties of the mind, \u215b fo adapt\u00e9d to. the prevailing fyftem, that it cannot fit any other \u215d like a coat drat fits the man for whom it was made, .and fhews him to advantage, which yet will, fit very aukward upon one of a different; make,, although as handfome and well proportioned. It is hardly poffible to make any innovation in our philofophy concerning the mind and its operations,-without ufing new words and phrafes, or giving a different meaning to thofi that are received.\u201d With equal propriety may this folid remark be applied to the great fubje\u00a3t, on the principles of which the de~ cifion of this Coqrt is to be founded. The perverted ufe of genus andJpecies in logic, and of imprejjions and ideas in metaphy-jics, have never done mifehief fo extenfive or iopraclically pernicious, . as has been done, by States and fovereigns, in politics and jarifpru\u00e1cnce \u00a1 .in the politics and jurifprudetice. even of thofe, who wiilred and meant to be free. 1\u215b the-place, of thofe ex^ prefitonsl intend not to lubftitute pew ones \u215c b,ut the exp ref, fibns themfelves I fliall certainly ufe for purpofes- different from thofe, for which hitherto they have been frequently ufed \u00be and one pf them I ihall apply to ah abjedt ftili more different from that, 'to which it has hitherto been., mo-re frequently, ,1 may fay almoft univerfally, applied. In thsfepur-pofes, and in this application, I.fballhe juftified by example the.',molt fplendid, and by authority the -moft binding ; the example of the\u2019molt refined as well as the moft. free .nation .known, to antiquity -, and the authority of one. of, the beft Conftitutions known to modern times; With regard.to.one. of the terms\u2014-State\u2014this authority is declared ; With regard tathe other\u2014fovereign\u2014the authority is implied only : Bu-t it is ..equally, ftrong :. For. -in an. inftrument. well drawn, as ih a poem well cpmpofed,, inepr.e is fometimes \u2022 moft expreffive\n. To the Conftitution of .the UnitedJstates: the'term sovereign* is totally unknown. . There is but one place where it could have been uled with propriety. ' But, ev\u00e9n in- that place it would not, -perhaps, have comported with the delicacy of -thpfe, who ordained and ejiablijfjed that Conftitution. -They might have announced themfelves' \u201c sovereign\u201d , people.-of the United Staes: But fereuely confcioiis-of the fact, they1 avoided the ojlentatious declaration.,\nHaving thus avowed my difapprobatioii of the purpofes, for which' the terms, State and fovereign, axe frequently uied,. and of the objebt, to which the. applicat- a of the laft pf them is almoft. uni'veifally lftade.j it is now proper that I ihpuld difclofe \"the'meafling, which I, affign' t\u00e1 both, ,and jbe application, \u2022which'I make of the. latter. In doing this, I ihall have oo-caiion' incidently to evince, how true it is, that States and Governments'were made for man ; and, at the fame time,' how true it is, that his creatures zvAfefvants have firft deceived, next \u25a0vilified, and, at \u215b\u215c opprejfed their majler and maker.\nMan,-fearfully and wonderfully made, is the workmanlhip of his all perfect CreAtoR : A State; ufeful and valuable as the. contrivance is, is the inferior contrivance of man; and from his native dignity derives all its acquired importance.. When I fpeak of a State as an inferior contrivance, I mean that it is a contrivance inferior only to. that, which is divine - Of all human contrivances, it is certainly molt tranlcendantly excellent. It is concerning this conti ivance that Cicero fays f\u00f3 fublimely, \u201c Nothing, which is exhibited upon our globe, is more acceptable to that divinity, which governs the whole uni., verfe, than thofe communities and .affemblages of men, which, lawfully alfociated, are denominated States\n*\n\u201d.\nLet a State be confidered as fubordinate to the .people : But let every thing elfe be fubordinate to the State. The latter part of this pofition is equally neceflary with the former, \u2022 For in the practice, and even at length, in the fcience of politics there has very frequently been a ftrong current againft, the natural order of things, and an inconfiderate or an intereiled difpofition to lacrifice the end to the means. As the \u25a0 State has claimed precedence .of the people ; fo, in the fame' inverted courfe of things. thp\u2019 Government has often claimed precedence of the State; and to this perverlion in the fecond degree, many of the volumes of confufion concerning fovereignty. owe their exiftence. The. minflers, dignified very properly by the appellation of the magfirates, have wifhed, and have fucceeded in their wilh, to be confidered as the fovereigns of- the State. This fecond degree of perverlion is confined to the old world, and begins to diminilh feven there ; but the firfl degree; 3s ftill too prevalent, even in the feveral States, of which our union is eompofed. By a State I mean, a complete body of free perfons united together foi their common benefit, to enjoy peaceably what is their own, and to do juilice to. others. It is an artificial perfoh. It has its affairs and its interefls : It has its rules : T): has \"its rights: And it has its obligations. It may acquire property diftinct from that.of its members*. It may incur debts to be difeharged out of the public flock,. not out of the private fortunes-of individuals. It maybe bot\u00edhd by contrails ; and for'damages arifing from the breach of thofe contrails. .In all our contemplations, however, concerning this feigned and artificial perfon, we ihould never forget, jh'at, in truth and nature, thofe, who think and fpeak, and \u215e\u00be are men.\nIs the foregoing defcription of'a State a true defcription i It will not be queftioned but it is.. Is there any part of .this def-cription, which\u2019intimatcs, in the remoteit manner, that a State, any mo.r\u00e9 than the men who compofe it, ought not to do juftic\u00a9 and fulfil engagements ? It will not be pretended that there is. If juftice is not done ; if engagements are not fulfilled,j is it upon general principles of right, lefs proper, in the cafe of a great number, than in the cafe of an individual, to fecure, by compulfion, that, which will not be voluntarily performed ? Lefs proper it furely carinotbe. The only reafon, I believe, why a free man is bound byhuman, laws, is, that he binds himfelf. Upon th\u00a9 fame principles, upon which he becomes bound by the laws, he be- \u2019 comes amenable to the Courts of Juftice, which are formed and authorifed by thofe laws. If one free man, an original Sovereign, may do all this ; why may not an aggregate of free men, a collection of original fovereigns, do this like wife ? If the dignity of each Jingly is undiminiihed \u2022, the dignity of all jointly muft be unimpaired. A State, like a merchant, makes a contract : A diftioneft State, \u215d like a diihoneft merchant, wilfully refufes to difcharge it : The latter is amenable to a Court of Juftice : Upon general principles Of right, lhall the former when fummon-eA to anfwcr.the fair demands of its creditor, be permitted, proteus-like, to aflume a new appearance, and to infult him and juftice, by declaring I am a sovereign State ? Surely not. Before a claim, fo contrary^ in its firft appearance, to the general principles of right and equality, be fuftained by a juft and impartial tribunal, the perfon, natural or artificial, entitled to make fuch claim,, fhould certainly be well known and authenticated. Who,or what, isa Sovereignty ? What is his or its fo-vereignty ? On this fubjedt, the errors and the mazes are end-\u25a0lefs arid inexplicable.' To enumerate all, therefore, will not be expedled: To take, notice of fome will be neceflary to the frill illufiration of the prefent important caufe- In one fenfe, the termfovereign has for - its correlative, fubjeB, In this fenfe, the term can receive no application j for it has 'no object in the Conftitution of the United States. Under' that. Conftiturion 'there are citizens, but no fubjeBs. <( Citizen of the United States\n*\n\u201d. \u201c Citizens of another State.\u201d \u201c Citizens of different States.\u201d . \u201c \u00c1 State or citizen thereof-}-\u201d. The term, fubjerit, occurs, indeed, orice in the inftrument; but to mark-the contrail ftrongly, the epithet. \u201c foreign\u201d!. is prefixed. In this fenfe, I prefume the State of Georgia has no claim upon feer-own citizens: In this fenfe, I am certain, Hie can have no claim upon the citizens of another State.\nIn another fenfe,'according to-fome writers*-, every State,. which governs itfelf without any dependence on another powder, is a foveteign State.. Whether, with regard 'to her own citizens, this is the cafe of the State of Georgia \u00a1 whether thofe citizens have don\u00e9, as the individuals of England are laid, by. their late inftru\u00e9tors, to have done, furrendered the Supreme Power to the State or Government, and referved nothing to themfelves ; or whether, like the people of other States, and of the United States, the citizens of Georgia have referved the Supreme Power in their own - hands j and on that Suprem\u00e9 Power have made the State dependent, initead of .being foVe-reign ; thefe are queftions, to which, as a Judge in this caufe, I can neither know nor fuggeft the proper ajifwers ; though, aS \u25a0a citizen of the Union, I know, and-am interefted to know, that the molt fatisfa&ory anfwers ' can be given. As a citizen,\" I know the Government of that State to be republican $ and my ihort definition of fuch a Government is,\u2014one conftru&ed on this principle, that the Supreme Power refides in the-body of the people. As, a Judge of this Court, I know, and caa decide upon the knowledge, that tht citizens of Georgia, when , they adted upon the large fcale of the Union, as a part of -the \u00ab People of ihe.United States \u201d did not furrender the Supreme or fovereigh PoWr to that State \u2022, but, .as to the purpofes of the Union, retained it to themfelves. As to the purpofes of the Union* therefore, Georgia is not a fmereign State. If the Judicial-decifion of this cafe forms one of thofe purpofes 5 Ac allegation, that Georgia is a fovereign State, is unfupported by the fa\u00a3h Whether the judicial decifion of this caufe is, or is n.ctt, one .of thofe purpofes, is a queftion which will be examined particularly in a fubfequent part of my argument* -\nThere is a third fenfe, in which the term fovereign is fre-1 quently.ufed, and which it is very material to trace and explain, as itfurnilhes a bails for what I prefume to be one of the -pricipal objedtions againftthe' jurifdi\u00e9tion of this Court over thd State of Georgia. In this fenfe, fov\u00e9reignty is derived from -\n*\nfeudal \u00edburce ; arid like many other parts of that fyftem fo degrading to man, ftill retains its influence over our fentiments and conduct, though the caufe, by. which that influence Was produced, never extended to the American States* The accurate and well informed Prefident Henault\u215c in his excellent chronological abridgment of the Hiftory of France, tells us, that, about the end of the fecond race of Kings, a new kind of pof-ieffion was acquired, under the name of' Fief. The Governor^ t\u00bbf' Cities and Provinces ufurped equally the propeity of land, and the adminjlration of jujiice \u00a1 and eftablifhed them felves as proprietary Seigniors over thofe places, in which, they had been only civil magiftrates or military officers. By this means, there was introduced into the State a new kind of authority, to which was ailigned the appellation of fovereignty\n*\n. In procefs of time the feudal fyftem was extended over \u2022 France, and al-moft all the other nations of Europe: And every Kingdom became, in f\u00e1\u00a3t, a large fief Into England this fyftem was introduced by the conqueror : and to this aera we may, probably, refer the;- Englijh maxim, that the King or fovereign is the fountain of Juftice. But, in the cafe of the King, the fove-vereignty had a double operation. While it veiled him with jurifdiftion over others, it excluded all others from jurifdifHon over him. With regard to him, there was no fuperior power; and, confequently, on feudal principles, no right of jurifdiftion. \u201c\n\u2020\nThe law, fays Sir William Bladflone, \u2022 afcribes to the King the attribute of fovereignty: he is fovereign and independent' within his own dominions; and owes no kind of objection to any other potentate upon earth. Hence it is, that no fuit or action, can b\u00e9 brought again ft the King, even in civil matters; becaufe' no Cburt can have jurifdiction over him; for alljurif-dhftion implies fuperiority of power.\u201d This laft pofition is only a branch of a much more extenfive principle, on which a plan of fyHematic defpotifm has been lately formed in England, and prcfecuted with unwearied ailiduity and care. Of this plan the .author of the Commentaries was, if not-the introducer, at leaft the great fupporter. \u25a0 He has been followed in it by writers later and lefs known ; and his dodtirines have, both on the other and this fide of the Atlantic, been implicitly and generally received bythofe, who neither examined their principles nor their coifie-quences, The principle is, that all.humati law muft be prefc'rib-ed by a fuperior. This principle I mean riot now to examine. Suffice it, at prefent to fay, that another.principle, very different in. its nature and operations, forms,' in my judgment, the baits of found and genuine jurifprudence ; laws derived from the pure fource of equality and juftice muft be founded on the \u25a0consent of thofe, whofe obedience they require. The fovereign, when trace& to his fource, muft be found in the man.\nI have now fixed, in the fcale of things, the grade of a State; and have defcribecl its cpmpofure : I have confidered the nature of fovereignty ; and pointed its application to the proper objeft. I have examined the queftion \u25a0 before us, by the principles of general jurifprudence^ In thofe principles I find nothing, which terids to evince \u00e1n exemption of the State of Georgia, from the jurifSi\u00a3tion of the Court. I find every thing to have a contrary .tendency,\nII. Iam, in the fec\u00f3nd place, to examine this .queftion by the laws and praftiee of different States and Kingdoms. In ancient Greece, as we learn from Ifocrates, whole nations defended their rights before crouded tribunals. Such occafions as thefe excited, we are told, all the powers of perfuafion j and the vehemence and enthufiafm of the fentiment was gradually infufed into the Grecian language, equally fufeeptibie of ftrength and harmony. In thofe\u2019 days, law, liberty, and refining, fcience, made their benign progrefs in ftrift and graceful union : The rude and degrading league between the bar and feudal barbarifm. was not yet formed.\nWhen the laws and praftiee of particular States have any application to the queftion before us ; that application willfuruiih what is called an argument a fortiori ; becaufe all the inftances produced will be inftances of fubjeBs inftituting and fupporti'ng fuits againft thofe, who were- deemed their own /oversigns. Thefe inftances \u00e1re ftronger than the prefent one -, becaufe between the prefent plaintiff and defendant no fuch unequal relation is alledged to exift.\nColumbus atchieved the difeovery of that country, which, perhaps, ought to bear his name. Acontraft made by Columbus furniihed the firft precedent for fupporting, in his dife\u00f3vered country, the caufe of injured merit againft the claims and pre-tentions of haughty and ungrateful power. His fon Don Diego, wafted two years in ineeffant, but fruitlefs, folicitation at the Court of Spain, for the rights which defeended to him in confe-quence of his father\u2019s original capitulation. H.e endeavoured, at length, to obtain, by a legal fentence, what he could not procure from the favour of an' interefted Monarch. He commenced a fuit againft Ferdinand before the Council, which managed Indian affairs \u201e\u2022 and that Court, with integrity which reflects honour on their proceedings, decided againft the King, and fe/lained Don Diego\u2019s claim.*\nOther States have inftituted officers to judge the proceedings-of their Kings : Of this kind were the Ephori of Spartaof this kind alfo was the mayor of the Palace, and afterwards the confiable of France.\n\u2020\nBut of all the laws and inftitutions relating to the prefent queftion, none is fo ftriking as that deferibed by the famous Hot-toman, in his book entitled Francogallia. When the Spaniards of Arragon eleft a King, they reprefent a kind of play, and introduce a perfonage, whom they dignify by the name of law, la fufliza, of Arragon. This perfonage they declare, by a public decree, to be greater and more powerful than their Kings and then addrefs him in the following remarkable \u25a0 expreffions.\n** We, who arc of as great worth as you, and can do. more than you can do, ele\u00a3t you to be our King, upon the conditions . Stipulated : .But between you and us there is one of \"greater authority than yo\u00fc.\u201d\n*\nIn England, according to Sir William Blackjlone-, no fuit cart be brought againit the King, even in civil matters. So, -in that Kingdom, is the law, at this time, received But it was not always fo. Under the Saxon Government, a very different doctrine was. held to be orthodox. Under that Government, as we are informed by the Mirror of Juftice, a boofc faid, by Sir Edward Coke, to have been written, in part, at leaft, before the conqueft ; under that Government it was ordained, that the King's Court ihouid be open to all Plaintiffsj by which, without delay, they ihouid have remedial writs, as well againit the King or againit the phtsen, as againit any other of the people.\n\u2020\nThe law-continued to be the fame for fome centuries after the conqueft.\nUntil the time of Edward I. the King might have been fued as a common person. The form of the process was even imperative. \"Pr\u00e6cipe Henrico Regi Angli\u00e6 &c. \"Command Henry King of England\u201d &c.\n\u2021\nBracton, who wrote in the time of Henry III. uses these very remarkable expreffions concerning the King \u201cin justitia recipienda, minimo de regno fuo comparetur\u201d\u2014\u201cin receiving justice, he should be placed on a level with the meanest person in the Kingdom\n\u00a7\n.\u201d True it is, that now in England the King must be sued in his Courts by Petition, but even now, the difference is only in the form, not in, the thing. The judgments or decrees of those Courts will sub-stantially be the same upon a precatory as upon a mandatory process. In the Courts of Justice, says, the very able author of the confiderations on the laws of forfeiture, the King enjoys many privileges; yet not to defer the subject from contending with him freely\n||\n. The judge of the High Court of Admiralty in England made, in a very late cause, the following manly and independent declaration. \u201c In any cafe, where the Crown is a party, it is to be obferved, that the Crown can no more withhold evidence of documents in its poffeffion, than a private perfon. If the Court thinks proper to order the production of any public inftrument; that order mujl be obeyed. Itwants.no Snjigma of an - authority derived from the Crown\n\u00b6\n.\u201d\n\" Judges ought to know, that the pdoreft peafant is a man as well as the King hirrtielf : all men ought to . obtain juftice ; lince in the eilimation of juftice, all men are equal ; .whether the Prince complain of a-peafant, or a peafant complain of the Prince-\u201d* Thefe are the words of a King, of the late Frederic of Bmjfia. I11 his Courts of Juftice, that great man flood his native greatnefs ; and difdained to mount upon the artificial ftilts of fovereignty.\nThus much concerning the laws and prafitice of other States and Kingdoms.. We fee nothing againft, but much in favour of, the jurifdi\u00f1ion of this Court over the State of Georgia, a party to this caufe.\n\u25a0III. I am, thirdly, and chiefly, to examine the important queftion now before us, by the Conftitution of the United States, and the legitimate refult of that valuable mftrumer.t. Under this view, the queftion is naturally fubdivided into two others. 1. Could the Conftitution of the United-States veil a jurifdiftion over the State of Georgia ? a. Has that Conftitution veiled fuch jurifdhftion in this Court ? I have already remarked, that in the practice, and even in the fcience of politics, there has been frequently a ftrong current againft the natural Order of things ; and an inconfidcrate or an interefied difpofition -to faerifice the end to the means. This remark dererves a more particular illuftration. Even in aimoft every nation, v/hich has been denominated free, the fate has affirmed a fupercilious preeminence above the people, who have formed it : Hence the haughty notions offate independence,fate-fovereignty and fate fu-premacy. In defpotic Governments, the Government has ufurp-ed, in a fimilar'manner, both upon the fate and the people : Hence all arbitrary doctrines and pretenfions concerning the Supreme, abfolute, and incontrolable, power o\u00ed Government. In each, man is degraded from the prime rank, which he ought to hold in human affairs : In the latter, thefate as well as the man is degraded. Of both degradations, (hiking inftances occur in htftory, in politics, and in common life. One of them is drawn from an anecdote, which is recorded concerning Louis XIV. who has been (tiled the grand Monarch of France. This Prince, who diffufed around him fo much dazzling fplendour, and fo little vivifying heat, was vitiated by that inverted man-, ner of teaching and of thinking, which forms Kings to he tyrants, without knowing or even fyfpedting that they are fo. - \u2022 The op-prelfion, under which he held his fubjedls during the whole courfe of his long reign,^proceeded chiefly from the principles and habits' of his erroneous education. Ky thefe, he had been \u00e1ccuftomed to confider his Kingdom as his patrimony, and his power over his fubjje&s as his. rightful and undelegatcd inheritance. Thefe fentiments were fo deeply and ftrongly imprinted pn.his mind, that when one of his Miniflers reprefented to .him-the mif\u00e9rable condition, to which thofe fubje&s were reduced, and, in the c\u00f3urfe of his representation, frequently uf-ed the word UEtat, the fate, the King, though he felt the truth. \u00bbnd approved the fubftance of all that was faid, yet was fliock-$d at; the frequent -repetition of the exprdfian L\u2019ptat,- and complained of it it a's an indecency offered to his petfon and character. And, indeed, that Kings ihould imagine themfelves the final canfies, for which men were made, and fiocieties were-formed, and Governments were inftituted, will ceafe to he a matter of wonder or furprife* when we find that lawyers, and ftatef-xue\u00bb, and philofophers, have taught or favoured .principles,'which neceffarily lead to the fame conclufion. Another inftance, equally ftrong, but ftill more aftonifhing, is drawn from the Hriiifih Government, as deferibed by Sir William Blacljlone and iris followers. As deferibed by him and them, the Britijh is a \u00bfefpotie Government, it is a Government .without a-people. In, that Government, as fo deferibed, the fiovereignty is poflefled by the Parliament : In the Parliament, therefore, the fupreme an.d abfolute authority is vefted :* In the Parliament refid'es that incontrolable and defpotic' povi\u00a1er, which, in ail Governments, muft refidc fomewhere. The conftituent parts of the Parliament'are the King's Majefty, the' Lord\u2019s Spiritual, the lord\u2019s Temporal, and the Commons. The King and thefe three Eft a tes together form the great corporation or body politic of the Kingdom. All thefe fentiments are found j the laft expref-\u00edions are found \u2022verbatim\u2020 in the commentaries upon the laws of England.\n\u2020\nThe Parliament fonn the great body politic of England ! What, then, or inhere, are the people ?' Nothing 1\nNo \u2022where ! They are not. fo much as even the <c bafelefs fabric of a vifion !\u201d From legal contemplation they totally difappear ? Am I not warranted in faying, that, if this is a juft defeription j a Government, fo and juftly fo deferibed, is a defpotic Government ? Whether this defeription is or is not a juft one, is 3 queftion of very different import.\n. In the United States, and in the feveral -States, which coto-pofe the Union, we go not fo far : but ftill we go one Jlep farther than we ought to. go in this unnatural and inverted order of things. The Jlat'es, rather than the people, for whofe fakes the States exift, are frequently the objefts which attract and arreft our principal attention. This, I believe, has produced much of the confufion and' perplexity, which' have appeared . in fcveral proceedings and feveral publications on ftate-politics, and on the politics, too,. of the United States. Sentiments and expref-lio-ns.o-f this inaccurate kind prevail in our common, even in our convivial,'language. Is a t\u00f3aft afkeu ? \u00ab The United States,\u201d inftead of the *\u00ab People of the United States,\u201d is the toaft gir ven. This is not politically correft. The toaft Is meant to pre-fent to view thefihjl great object in the Union i It prefents only < \\ye\"Jecdnd s It pfefents only.the artificial perfon, inftead of the. natural perfons, who Tpoke it into exil\u00edente. A State I cheer\u215b fully admit, is the nobleft work of Man s But, Man free and honeft, is, I fpeak as to this world, the nobleft of God.\nConcerning the prerogative of. Kings, and concerning the fovereignty of States, much has been faid and written ; but little has been faid and written concerning a fubjecl . much more dignified and important, the majefty of the people. The mode', of expreflion, which I would fubftitut'e in the place of that generally ufed, is noionlj politically, but alfo (for between true liberty and true tafte there is a clofealliance) dajficnlly more corrcdl. On the mention of Athens, a thoufand refined and endearing \u25a0affociations rulh at once into the memory of the fchoJar, the fhilofopher, and the patriot. When Homer, one of the moft cot-redl, as well as the oldeift of human authorities, enumerates the -other nations of Greece, whofe forces- acted at the liege of Troy, he arranges them under the names of their different Kings at Princes ; But when he comes to the Athenians, he diftinguiflua them by the peculiar appellation of the people\n*\nof Athens: The well known addrels ufed by Demojlhenes, when he bar-rangued and animated his affembled countrymen, was \u201c O Men of AthensT With the ftridleft propriety, therefore, clafftccd and \u25a0political, our national feene opens with the moft magnificent ob-.. jedt, which the nation could prefent. <\u00ab The people of the-United States\u201d are the firft perionages introduced. Who 'were thofe people i They were the citizens of thirteen States, each of which had a feparate Conftitution and Government, and all of which were canne&ed together by articles of confederation. To the purpofes of public ftrength and felicity, that confederacy was totally inadequate. A requifition on the feveral States terminated-its LegiJlative authority : Executive or Judicial authority it had none. In order, therefore, to form a mor\u00e9 perfedt union, to efiabltfh jujtice, to enfure domeftic tranquillity, to provid\u00e9 for common defence, and to fecure the bleffings of liberty, thofe people', among whom were the people of Georgia, ordained and eftablilhed the prefent Conftitution. By that Con-ftitution Legislative power is veiled, Executive power is veiled, Judicial power is veiled.\nThe.queftionnow opens fairly to our view, could the people of thofe States, among whom were thofe of Georgia, bind thofe States, and Georgia among the others, by the Legiflative, Executive, and Judicial power fo veiled l If the principles, on Chichi have foundedmyfelf, are juft and true 5 this queilion-muft unavoidably receive an affirmative anfwer. If thofe States were the work o\u00ed thofe people s thofe people, and,, that I may apply.the caf\u00e9 clofely, the\u2019people of Georgia, in particular, could alter, as they pleafed, their former work: To any given! degree, they could diminifh as well as enlarge it. Any or all of' the former State-powers, they could extinguijh or transfer. The inference, which rieceflarily refults, is, that the Conftitu* tion ordained and eftabliihed by thofe people 5 and, {till clofely to apply the cafe, in particular by the people of Georgia, could veil jurifdidlion or judicial power over thofe States-and over the State of Georgia in particular.\nThe next queftion under this head, is,\u2014Has the Con\u00edlitution done fo ? Did thofe people mean to exercife this, their un\u00ed doubted power ? Thefe queftions may be refolved, either by fair and conclufive deductions, or by diredt and explicit dec\u00eda* rations. In order^ ultimately, to difcover, whether the people of the United States intended to bind thofe States b.y the Judicial power veiled by the national Con\u00edlitution, a previous en-quiry will naturally be : Did thofz people intend.to bind thofe fates by the Legiflative power veiled by that Con\u00edlitution ? The articles of confederation, it is well known, did not operate upon individual citizens \u00a1 but operated only upon fates, This defeat was remedied by the national Con\u00edlitution, which, as all ssHovj, has an operation on individual citizens. But if an opinion, which fome feem to entertain, be juft; the defect remedied, on- one fide, was balanced by a defedt introduced on the other; For they feem to think, that the prefent Con\u00edlitution operates only on individual citizens, and not on States. This opinion, however, appears to be altogether unfounded. When certain laws of the States are declared to be {f fubjedl to there-vision and controul of the Congress;\u201d\n*\nit cannot, furely, be contended that the Legiflative power of the national Government was meant to have no operation on the feveral States. The fatt, uncontrovertibly eftabliihed in one inflance, proves the principle in all other inftances, to which the fadts will be found to apply. We may then infer, that the people of the United States intended to bind the feveral Sta:es, by the Legiflative power of the national Government.\nIn order to make the difcovery, at\"which we ultimately aim, a second previous enquiry will naturally be\u2014Did the people of the United States intend to bind the feveral States by the Executive power of the national Government? The affirmative answer' to the former queftion diredts, unavoidably, an affirmative anfwer to this. Ever lince the time of Bratton, his maxim, I believe, has been deemed a good one-\u20144* Supervacuum ejfet leges tondere, nift ejfet qui leges tueretur.\u201d\n\u2020\n\u201c It would be fuperfluous' to make laws, unlefs thofe laws, when made, were to be enforced.\u201d- When the laws are plain, and the application of them is uncontrovert\u00e9d, they are enforced immediately by the Executive authority of Government. When the application of them is doubtful or intricate, the interpoiition of the judicial authority becomes neceflary. The fame principle, therefore, Which directed us from the firfl to the fecond ftep, will direct us from the fecond to the third and lafl flep of our deduction. Fair and conclufive deduction, then, evinces that the people of the United States did veft this Court with jurifdifticn over the State of Georgia. The fame truth may be deduced from the declared objects % and the general texture of the Conftitution of the United States. One of its declared objefts is, to fotm an union more perfeift, than, before that time, had been formed-. Before that time, the Union poiTeiled Legiflative, but unittforced Legiflative power- over the States. Nothing could be more natural than to intend, that this Legiflative power ihould be enforced by powers Executive and- judicial-. Another declared object is, \u201c to eftablifh juftice.\u2019\u2019 This points, in a particular manner, to the Judicial authority. And wheii we view this object in conjunction with the declaration, <c that no State \u00edh\u00e1\u00edl pafs a; law impairing. the obligation of contra\u00e9is we ihall probably think, that Ais objeft points,' in a particular man-' ner,. to the jurifdiifion of the Court over the feveral States. What good purpof\u00e9 could this Conftitutional provilion fecure, if a State might pafs a law impairing the obligation of its ontsn contrails ; and' be amenable, for fuch a violation' of right, to no \u00bfotttrouling judiciary power ? We have feen, that-on the principles of general jur\u00edfpr\u00fcdence, a State, for the breach of a contrail, may be liable- for damages. A .third declared objeit .is\u2014\u201c to enfure domeftic tranquillity.\u2019* 'This tranquillity is molt likely to be difturbed by controverfies between States. Thefe corifequences will be molt peaceably and- effeitually decided by-the eftabli&ment and by tlie exercife'of a fiiperiiitending judicial authority. ' By fuch ex\u00e9rcife and eftabliftment, the law of nations ; the rule between' contending States ; will be\u2018enforced-among the feveral States, in the fame manner as municipal-law.\n- \u2019 Whoever confiders, in a combined and compr eh\u00e9tifive view, the general texture of the-Conftitution, will be fatisfied, that the people of the United States intended to form'themfe\u00edves into a nation for national purpofes.- They inftitut\u00e9d, for fuch pur-po\u2019fes, a national Government, complete in-jall ks parts, with powers Legiflative, Executive and Judiciary; and, in all thofe powers, extending oyer the whole nation. Is it congruous,' that, with regard'do fuch purpofes, any man dr body of men, any perfon natural or artificial,' ihould be permitted to claim fuc-cefsfully an entire exemption from the jt\u00edrifditlion of the national Government ? Would not fuch claims, crowned with' fuccefs, be repugnant to our very exigence as a nation ? When fo many trains of decluffion, coming from different quartet's, converge and unite, at laid, in the fame point; we may fafely conclude,. as the legitimate refult o\u00ed this Conftitution, that the State of Georgia is amenable to the jurifdiction of this Court.\nBut, in my opinion, this do&rine refts not upon the legitimate refult of fair and conclufive deduction from the Conftitution \u2022: It is confirmed, beyond all doubt, by the direct and explicit declaration of the Conftitution itfelf. {i The judicial power of the United States fliall extend, to controverfies between two States.\u201d\n*\nTwo States are fuppofed \u2019 to have a controverfy between them : This controverfy is fuppofed tobe brought before thofe veiled with the judicial power of the United States : Can the moft confummate degree of jjrofeffional ingenuity, de-vife a mode by which this \u201c controverfy between two States\u201d can be brought before a Court of law; and yet neither of thofe States be a Defendant -? \u201c The judicial power of the United States {hall extend to controverfies, between a fate and citizens of another State.\u201d Could the ftridleft legal language ; could even that language, which is .peculiarly appropriated to an art, deemed, by a great, mailer, to be one of the moft honorable, laudable, and profitable things in our law ; could-'this ftiift and appropriated language, deferibe, with more, precife qcc.uracy, the caufe now depending before the tribunal ?. Caufes, and not parties to caufes, are weighed by ju\u00edtic\u00e9, in her equal feales : On the former jolely, her attention is fixed1: To the latter,- ihe is, as Ihe is painted, blind.\nI have now tried this queftionby all the'toucliftones,'to which I propofed to apply it. I -have examined it by the principles of general jurlfprudence^ fty the laws and praftice of States and Kingdoms ; and by the Conftitution of the 'United States. From -all, the combined inference is,- that the action lies.\nCushihg, Jufice.\nThe grand and principal queftion in this cafe is, whether a State can, by the Feeders! Conftitution,' be fued by-an individual citizen of another State i\nThe point turns not upon the law or practice of England, although perhaps it may be in fome meafure elucidated thereby, nor upon the law of any other country whatever; but upon tlieiConftitution eftablifhed by the people of tht United States \u00a1 and particularly apon the extent of powers given to the Fcede-ral Judicial in the 2dfection of the 3d article of the Conftitution. It is declared that \u201c the Judicial power fliall extend to all cafes in law and equity arifing under the Conftitution, the laws of the United'Hates; .entreaties made or which {hall be made under their authority ; to all cafes a\u00a3Fe\u00a3ting ambafladors or other public minifters and confu\u00eds ; to all cafes .of admiralty and maritime jurifdiftion to controverfies, tq which-the United States fhall be a party ; to controverfies between two or more States and citizens of another State ; between citizens of different States'; between citizens of the fame State claiming lands under grants of different States; and between a State and citizens thereof and foreign' States, citizens or fubjefts.1\u2019' The. judicial power, then, is exprefsly extended to \u201c controverfies between a State and citizens of another State.\u201d When a citizen makes a demand againfl a State, of which he is not a citizen, it is as really a controverfy between a State and a citizen of another State, as if fuch State made a demand againfl fuch citizen. The cafe,' then, feems clearly to fall within the letter of the Conftitution. It may be fuggefted- that it could not be intended to fubjedt a State to- be a Defendant, becaufe it would effeft the fovereignty of States. If that be the -cafe, what- fhall we do with the immediate preceding elaufe ; \u201c controverfies- betvieen two' or more States,\u201d where a State muft of neceflity be Defendant i If it- was not the intent, in the very next elaufe aifo> that a State might be made Defendant,, why was-it. foexpreffed as naturally to lead to and- comprehend- that idea ? Why w as not an exception made if one'was intended ?.\nAgain \u2014what are w:e to do,with the laft elaufe of. the febtion of judicial powers, viz. Gontr.overfes between, a fate, or. the citizens thereof, and. foreign fates or citizens ?\u201d Here again, States muft be fuable or liable to be made Defendants, by this elaufe, which has a fimilar mode of language with the two other claufes I have remarked upon. For if. the judicial power exr tends to a controverfy between one of. the United States and a foreign State, as the elaufe expreffes, one of them muft be Defendant. . And thenj what becomes of the fov.ereignty Of States as. far as filing affebts, it ? .- But although the words, appear reciprocally to affe\u00f1 the State here and a foreign State,, and put them on the fame footing as far as may be,, yet ingenuity may, fay, that the State here may. fue, but cannot be fued.j but that the foreign State may be fued but cannot fue. We may touch foreign fovereignties hut not our own.. But I conceive the reaT fon of the thing, as well, as the words of the Cpnftitution, tend to ihew that the Feed eral Judicial power, extends to a fuit brought by a foreign State againft any one of the United States. One defign of the general. Government was for managing the great affairs of peace and war and the general- defence^ which were impoffible to be condudled, with fafety, by the Statesyi-paratdy. \u2022 Incident to thefe powers, and. for preventing contro-v.erfies between, foreign powers, or citizens from rifing to extremities and toan appeal to the fword, a national tribunal was iieceffary, amicably to decide them, and thus ward' off fuch fatal, public calamjty. Thus, States.at home and-their;citizens, and foreign States and their citizens! are put together without-diftinftion upon the fame tooting, as far as may be, as-to contro-. verfies between them* So alfo, with refpefil to controverfies between a State and citizens of another State\u2019(at home) comparing all t: e claufes together, the remedy is' reciprocal ; the claim to juftice equal. As controverfies between State and State, and between a State and citizens of another State, might tend dually to involve States in war and bloodihed, a difinterefted civil tribunal was intended to be inftituted to decide fuch con*, troverfies, and preferve peace and friendfhip.- Further \u215c if a State is entitled to Juftjqe in the Fcederal Court, againft a citizen of another State, why not fuch citizen againft the State,' when the fame language equally comprehends both ? The rights of individuals and the j uiiice due to them, are-as dear and precious as thofe of States. Indeed'the latter are founded upon the former ; and the great end and objedt of them mu\u00edt be to fecure and fupport the rights of individuals, or elfe vain is Government.\nBut {till it' may be infilled, that this will reduce States' to-mere corporations, and take away all fovereignty. As to corporations, all States whatever are corporations ox bodies politic. The only quellion is, what are their powers ? As to individual States and the United States, the Conftitution marks the boundary of powers. Whatever power is dcpofited with the Union by the people for their own neceflary fee urity, is.fo far a curtailing of the power and prerogatives of States. This is, as it were, a felf-evident propofition ; at leaft it cannot be contefted. Thus the power of declaring w\u00e1r, making peace, railing and fupporting armies for public, defence, levying duties, cxcifes and taxes, if neceflary, with many other powers, are lodged in, Congrefs j and are a moil eflential abridgement of Stare fovereignty,' Again ; the reitriftions upon States ; \u201c No State ihall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation, coin, money, emit hills of credit, make'any thing bid gold and fiver a, tender in payment of debts, pafs any Jaw impairing the obligation of contrasts f thefe, with a number of others, are important reftridlions of the power of States, and were thought necef-fary to. maintain the Union; and to e\u00edlabiifti fome fundamental uniform principles of public juftice, throughout the whole Union. So that, I think, no argument of force can be taken from the fovereignty of States. Where it has been abridged, it was thought neceflary for the greater indifpcn fable good of the whole. If the Conftitution i& found inconvenient in praftice in this or any other particular, it is well that aregular mode is, pointed out for amendment. \u25a0 But; while it remains,'all offices Legiflative, Executive, and Judicial, both of the States and the Union, are bound by \u00f3ath tq fupport it.\nOne other objeftion has been fuggefted, that if a State may be fued by a citizen of another State, then the United States may be fued by a citizen of any of the. States, or, in otheT words, by any of their citizens. Jf this be-a neceffary confe-quence, it.muft be fo. I doubt the confequence,. from the different wording of the different claufes, connected with other reafons. When fpeaking of the United States, the Conftitution fays \u201c controverftes to -which the United States fall he a party\u201d not controverftes between the United States and any of their citizens. When fpeaking of States, it fays, conireverftes he* tween two or more fates ; between a fate and citizens of another date\u201d As to reafons for citizens fuing a different State, which do not hold equally good for fuing the United States ; one may be, that as controverftes between a State and citizens of another State, might have a tendency to involve both States'in conteft, 'and perhaps in war, a common Umpire to decide fuch controver-f\u00edes, may have a tendency to prevent the mifehief. That an object of this kind was had in view by the framers of the Confti-tution, I have no.doubt, when I confider the claihing interfering laws which were made in the neighbouring States, before the adoption of the Conftitution, and fome affecting the property of citizens of another State in a very different manner from that of their ow.n citizens. But I do not think it neceffa-ry to enter fully into the queftion, whether the United States are liable to be fued by an individual citizen ? In order to decide the point before us. Upon the whole,. I am of opinion, that the Conftitution warrants a fuit again a State, by an individual citizen of another State,\nA fecond queftion made in the cafe was, whether the particular action of ajfumpftt could lie againft a State ? I think af-fumpfit will lie, if any fuit; provided a State is capable of contra&ng.\nThe third queftion refpefls the competency of fervice, which I apprehend is good and proper ; the fervice being by fummons and notifying the fuit to the Governor ana the Attorney General -, the Governor, who is the Supreme Executive Magiftrate \u25a0and.reprefentative of the State,- who is bound by oath to defend the State, and by the Conftitution to give information to the Le-gillature of all important matters which concern' the inteieft of the State j the Attorney General who is bound to defend the \u2022 iptereft of the State in Courts of Law.\nJay, Chief Juf'iee. ' The queftion we are now to decide has been accurately ftated, viz. Is a State f\u00faable by individual citizens of- another State P\nIt is Laid, that Georgia refufes to appear and anfwer to the Plaintiff in- this adtio'n, becaufe {he is a fovereign State, and therefore not liable to fuch actions. In order to afeertain the me-fits of .this objection, let us enquire, lit. In what fenfe Georgia is fovereign State. 2d. Whether fuability is incomputable with fuch fevereignty. 3d, Whether the Conftit-ution (to which Georgia is a party) authorifes fuch an attio'n againft her.\nSuability znd ftiable are words not in common ufe, but they conciiely and correCtly convey the idea annexed to them.\n1st. In determining the fenfe in which Georgia is a fovereign State, it may be ufeful to turn\u2019our attention to the political fitu-aiion we were in, prior to the Revolution, and to the political rights which emerged from the Revolution. All the tountry now poifefled by the United. States was then a part of the dominions appertaining to the crown of Great Britain. Every acre of land in this country was then held mediately- or immediately by grants from that crown. All the people of this country were then, fubjects of the King of Great Britain, and owed allegiance to him ; and all the civil authority then exifting or exercifed here, flowed from the head'\" of the Briti/h Empire. \u2022They were in fenfe fellmv fubje\u00e9ls, and in a variety of refpe\u00a3t& one people. When the Revolution commenced, the patriots did not aflfert that only the fame affinity and focial con - neflion fubfifted between the people, of the colonies, which fub-filled between the people of Gaul, Britain, and Spain, while Roman Provinces, viz. only that affinity and focial connection which refult from the mere circumftance of being governed by the fame Prince ; different ideas prevailed, and gave occafjon to the Con-grefsoi 1774 and 1773-.\nThe Revolution, or rather- the Declaration of Independence* found the people already united for general purpofes, and at the fame time providing for their more domeltic concerns by State conventions, and other temporary arrangements. From the crown of Great Britain, the fovereignty of their country palled to. the people of it ; and it was then not an uncommon opinion, that tfie unappropriated lands, which belonged to that crown, paffed not to the people of the Colony or States within wholelimits they were fituated, but to the whole people; on whatever principles this opinion relied, it did not give-way to the other, and thirteen fovereignties were confidered as emerged from the principles of the Revolution, combined with local convenience and conlklerations ; the people neverthelefs continued to conlider themfelves, in a national point of view, as one people ; and they continued without ' interruption to manage their national 'concerns accordingly ; afterwards, . in the hurry of the war, and in the warmth of mutual confidence, they made a confederation of the States, the bafis of a general Government.' Experience difappoirited the expectations they had formed from it; and then the people, in their collective and national capacity, eilablijhed the prefent Conllitution. It is r\u00ae-markable.that in eftablifhing it, the people exercifed their own rights, and their own proper fovereignty, and confcious of the plenitude ''of it, they declared with becoming dignity, \u201c We *ithe people of the United States, do ordain and eftabliih this <* Conflatution.\u201d Here we fee the people adling as fovereigns of the whole country; and in the language of fovereignty, ef-tablifhing a Conftitution by which it was their will, that the State Governments ihould be bound, and to which the State Conftitutions ihould be made to conform. Every State Confti-tution is a compact made by and between-the citizens of a State to govern themfelves in a certain manner ;.-and the Conftitution. of the United States is likewife a compact made by the people of the United States to govern themfelves as tp general ob-je\u00a3ls, in a certain. manner. By this great compafit howeyer, many prerogatives were transferred to, Ae national Government, fuch as thofe of making war and peace, cont-radting alliances, coining money, &c. &c.\nIf^ then it be true, that the fovereignty of the nation is in the people of the nation, and the refiduary fovercinty of each Stats in the people pf each State, it may be ufeful to compare thefe fovereignties with thofe in Europe, that we may thence be enabled to judge, .whether all the prerogatives which are allowed to the latter, are fo effential to the former. There is reafon to fufpefl. that fome of the difficulties which, embarrafs the prefent queftion, arife from inattention to differences which fubfift between them.\nIt will be fufficient to obferve briefly, that the fovereignties \u215b Europe, and particularly in' England, exift oh feudal principles. That fyftem confiders the Prince as the fovereign, and the people as his fuljects ; it regards his perfon as the ofcjedt of allegiance, and excludes the idea of his being on an equal footing with a fubjedb, either in a Court of Juftice or elfewhere. Thai: fyftem contemplates him as being the fountain of honor and authority ; and from his grace and grant derives all fran-chifes, immunities and privileges ; it is eafy to perceive that fuch a fovereign could not be amenable to a Court of Juftice, or fubje&ed to judicial controul and actual conftraint. It'was of neceffity, therefore, that fuability became incompatible with fuch fovereignty. Befides, the Prince having all the Executive powers, the judgment of the Courts -would, in fa\u00a3t,be only monitory, not mandatory to him, and a capacity to be advifed, is a diftinft thing from a capacity to be fued. The fame feudal ideas run through all their jurffprudence, and conftantly remind us of the diftincuon between the Princezn\u00e1 the fdbject. \u2022 No iuc-h ideas obtain'here 5 at the Revolution, the fovereignty de-* volved on the pec\u2019ple ; and.'they are truly the fovereigns of the country, but they arefovereigns without Jahjecls (unlels the African flaves among us may be fo called) and have none to g\u00f3veft\u00ed-but thanfelves ; the citizens of America are equal as fellow citi* zens, and as joint tenants in the fovereignty.\nFrom the differences exifting between feudal fovereigntieS and Governments founded on compafts, it neceffarily follows that their refpeclive prerogatives mull differ. Soverignty is the right to govern j a nation or State-fovereign is'the perfon of perfons in whom that refides. In- Europe the fovereignty is generally afcribed t\u00ae the Prince.; here it refts with the people ; there; the fovereign a\u00e9tually adminiilers the .Government; here,, never in a fingle inftance; our Governors are the agents of the people, and at moft Hand in the fame relation to their fove-reign, in which regents in Europe Hand to their fovereigns. Their Princes haveperfonal powers, dignities, and pre-eminences, our rulers have none but official; nor do they partake in the fo-vereignty otherwife, or in any other capacity, than as private citizens.\n2d. The fecond objedt of enquiry now prefents itfelf, viz. whether fuahility is compatible with'State fovereignty.\nSuability, by whom ? Not a fubjedt, for in this country* there are. none ; notan inferior, for all ihe citizens being as to civilrights perfedlly equal, there is not, in that refpedf, one citizen inferior to another.- It is agreed, that one free citizen may fue another f the obvious dictates of j\u00fc\u00edlice, and the purpofes erf fociety demanding it. It is agreed, that one free citizen may fue any number on whom procefs can be conveniently executed ; nay) in certain cafes one citizen inay fue forty thou-fand 5 for where a corporation is fued, all the members of it arc a\u00f1ually fued, though not perfmally, fued. In this' city there are forty odd thoufand free citizens, all of whom may be collectively fued by any individual citizen. In the State of\u2019 .Delaware, there are fifty odd thoufand free citizens, and what teafon can be affigned why a free citizen who has demands a-gainft them-ihould not profecute them ? Can the difference between-forty odd thoufand, and fifty odd thoufand rrlake any diftindlion as to right ? Is it not as eafv,' and as convenient to the public and parties, to ferve a fummons on the Governor and Attorney General of Delaware, as on the Mayor or other Officefs of the Corporation of Philadelphia ? Will it be faid, that the fifty odd thoufand citizens in Delaware being affociatecl under a State Government, Hand\u2019in a rank fo fuperior to the forty odd thoufand of Philadelphia, - aflbciated under their charter, that although it may become the latter to meet an individu-ad on an equal footing in a Court ofjuftice) yet that fuch a procedure would not comport with the dignity of th\u00e9 former ?\u2014 \u2019 In this land of equal liberty, fhall forty odd thoufand in one place be cort\u00edpt-llabk to .do juitice, and yet fifty odd thoufand in smother place be privileged to do juftice only as they may think proper ? Such Objections would not correfpond with the equal tights we claim ;' with the' equality we profefs to admire and maintain, and with that popular fovereignty in which every citizen partakes. Grant that the Governor of Delaware holds an \u25a0office of fuperior rank to the Mayor of Philadelphia, they are both neverthelefs thei officers of the people ; and however mor\u00e9 exalted the one may be than the other, yet in the opinion of thof\u00e9 who dillike ariftocracy, that circumftance cannot be a good reafon for impeding the courfe of juftice\u00bb\nIf there be any fuch incompatability as fe pretended, Whence does it arife ? In what does it confift ? There is at leaft on\u00e9 ftrong undeniable faft againft this incompatibility, and that is this, any one State in the Union may fue another State, in this Court, that is, all the people of one State may fue all the people of another State\u00bb It is plain then, that a State may be J'ued> and hence it plainly follows, that friability and f\u00edate fovereignty are not incompatible. As one State may fue another State itt this Court,, it is plain .that no degradation toa State is thought to accompany her appearance in this Court. It is not therefore to an appearance in this Court that the objefilion points\u00bb To what does it point ? It points to an appearance at the f\u00fcit of one or more citizens. But why it fhould be more incompatible, that all the people of a State fhould be fued by one citizen, \u2022, than by one hundred thoufand, I cannot perceive, the procefs in both cafes being alike ; and the confequenees of a judgment alike. Nor can I obferve any greater inconveniencies in the One ^cafe than in the other,' except what may arife from the feelings of thofe who may regard a leiTer number m an inferior light-. But if any reliance be made on this inferiority as an objection, at leaft one half o\u00ed its force is done away by this fa\u00a1S, viz. that it is conceded that a State may appear in this Court as Plaintiff againft a fingle citizen as Defendant; and the truth is, that' the State of Georgia is at this moment profecuting an a \u00bflion in this Court againft two citizens of South Carolina.\n*\nThe only remnant of objection therefore that remains is, that the State is not bound to appear and anfwer as a Defendant at the fuit cf an individual t but why it is unreafonable that {he fhould be fo bound, is hard to conjecture : That rule is faid td b\u00e9 a bad one, which does not work both\u2019 ways 5 the citizens of Gorgin'are content with \u25a0 a right of fuing citizens of other States; but are not content that citizens of other States fliould have a right to fue them-.\nLet us now proceed-to equire whether Georgia has not, by being a party to the national compact, confented to be fuable by individual ^citizens of another State. This enquiry naturally 'leads our attention, ill. To the defign of the Conftitution\u00bb 2d. To the letter and exprefs declaration in it.\nPrior to the date of the Conftitution, the. people had not any national tribunal to which they could refort for juftice ; the diftribution of juftice was then confined to State judicatories, in whofe inftitution and organization the people of the other States had'no participation, and over whom they had not the leaft controul. There was then no general Court of appellate \u2022 jurifdidtion, by whom the errors of State Courts, affecting either the nation at large or the citizens of any other State, could \u25a0be revifed and corrected. Each State was obliged to, acquiefce ,iii the meafure of juftice which another State might yield to her, or to her citizens; and that even in cafes where State con-fiderations were not always favorable to the mod exadt meafure. There was danger that from this fource .animofities would in time r\u00e9fult; and as the tranfition from animofities to hoftilities was frequent in the hiftory of independent States, a common tribunal for the termination of controverfies became defirable, from motives both of juftice and of policy.\nPrior alfo to that period, the United States had, by taking a place among the nations of the earth, become amenable to the. laws\u2019of nations; find it was their intereft as well as-; their duty to provide;. that thofe laws \u00edhould be refpedted and obeyed ; in their national character and capacity, the United States -were vefponfiblc to foreign nations for .the c\u00f3ndudt of each State, relative to the laws \u00f3f nations, and the performance of treaties ; and there the inexpediency of referring all fuch queftions to State Courts, and particularly to the Courts of delinquent States became apparent. While ail the States were bound to protedt each, and the citizens of each, it was highly proper,and reafona-ble/that they \u00edhould be in a capacity, not only to caufe juftice to-be done & each, and the citiz\u00e9ns of each; but alfo to caufe juf-iice. to be done by each, and the citizens of each; and that, not by violence and force, but in a tt\u00e1ble; fedate, and regular courfe of judicial procedure.\nThefe weje among the evils againft which it was proper for the nation, that is, the people of all the United States, to pro- ' vide by a national judiciary, to be inftitutedby the whole nation, \u25a0 and to\" be vefponfible to the whole nation.\nLet us now turn to the Conftitution. The people therein declare, that their defign in eftabliihing it, comprehended fix objedts. 1 ft. To form a more perfedt union. 2d. Toeftabliih juftice. 3d. To eiifure domeftic tranquillity. 4th. To provide for the common defence. .5 th; To promote the general welfare.- 6th. To fecuve the bleffings of liberty to themfelves and th\u00e9ir poft\u00e9rity. It would be pleafing and ufcful to confider and trace the relations which each of thefe objedts bears to the others; and to \u00edhew that they colle&ively comprife every thing requi-fite, with the bleffing of Divine Providence* to render a-people profperous and happy ; on the prefent o.ccafion \u2022 fuch diiquifi-tions wo\u00fald be unfeafonable, becaufe foreign to the fubjedt immediately under confideration.\nIt may .he aflcedj. what-is the \u00a1 preeife fenfe and latitude in which the words \u201c to cflablijh jujlicc \u201d as,here fifed, .are to be underftood ? The anfwer- to this queftion. will refult from the provifiohs made in the Conftitution on this head.. They are Specified in the 2d. fedrion of the 3d article, where it is ordained, that the judicial power of the United States- ihall extend to ten deferiptions of cafes, viz. ift. To all cafes arifing under this Conftitution j becaufe the meaning, conftruction, and operation of a compadt ought always to be.afcertained by all the parties, or by authority derived only from one of them.' 2d. To all cafes arifing under the laws of- the United 'States\u25a0 j be-caufe as fuch laws conftitutionally made,- are obligatory on each State, the meafure of obligation and obedience ought not to be decided and fixed by the party frotn whom they.-are due, but by a .tribunal deriving authority from both the parties..- 3d. To'all cafes arifing. under' treaties made by their authority-; -be-caufe, as treaties are comp\u00e1dls made by, and obligatory 01ft the whole- -nation, their operation ought not to be affected .or regulated by the fecal laws or Courts of a part of the nation. 4th. To- all cafes 'affedting Ambaffadors, or other public \u2018 Minifters and Confu\u00eds \u2022, becaufe, as thefe are officers of foreign nations, whom this nation are bound to protedt and treat according to the laws of nations, cafes affedting them ought only to be cognizable by national authority. 5th. To. all cafes of Admiralty and Maritime j.urifdidtion; becaufe, as the feas-are the joint property of nations, wh\u00f3fe right and privileges relative, thereto, are regulated by the law of nations and treaties,, fuch cafes neceflaiil.y belong to national jufifdidtion. 6th- To controver-fies to which the United States ihall he a party j becaufe in cafes in which the whole .people are interefted, it would not be equal or wife' to let any one State decide and meafure out the juff ice due to others. 7th. To. controverfies between, two or more States ; becaufe domeftic tranquillity .requires, that the contcu-tionsof States ffiould be peaceably terminated by a common judicatory .; and, becaufe,. in a free country j-uftice ought not-to depend on the will of either of the litigants. \u2022 8th. To con-troverfies between a State and citizens of another State ; be-caufe in cafe a State (that is all the citizens of it) has demands againft. fome. citizens'of another State, it is better that llie. ffiould prcfecute their demands in-a national Court,' than in a Court of the State to-which thofe citizens belong ; the danger of irritation\u215b and criminations arifing from apprehenfions and fufpicions of partiality, being thereby obviated. Becaufe, fo cafes where fome citizens of one State have demands againft all the citizens of another State, the cauf\u00e9 of liberty and. the. rights of men forbid, that the latter fliould be the foie Judges, of the juflice due to the latter \u2022, and true- Republican Cavern-, ment requires that free and equal citizens fhould have free, fair, and equal juflice. pth, To controverfies. between citizens of the fame State, claiming lands under grants of different States ; becaufe, as the rights of. the two States to grant the'land, are drawn into queftion, neither of .the two States ought to decide .thecontroverfy. icth,' To.contro.verfies between a State, or the citizens thereof; and foreign States, citizens or fubjedls j becaufe, as every nation is refponfible for the conduit of its citizens towards-other nations ; all queftions touching the juf-i tice due to foreign nations, or people, ought to be afeertained by, and depend on.natipnal authority.' Even' this curfory view-of the judicial powers of the - United States, leaves the mind ftrongly imprefled with the importance of them to the prefer-, vhtionof the tranquillity, the equal, fovereignty, and the equal right of the people.\u2019\nThe question now before us renders it necessary to pay particular attention to that part of the 2d section, which extends the judicial, power \u201cto controversies between a state and citizens, of another state.\" It is contended, that this ought to be con-strued to reach none of these controversies, excepting those in which a State may be Plaintiff. The ordinary rules for construction will easily decide whether those words are to be understood in that limited sense.\nThis extension of power is remedial, because it is to settle controversies. It is therefore, to be construed liberally. It is politic, wife, and good, that, not only the controversies, in which a State is Plaintiff, but also those in which a State is Defendant, should be settled; both cases, therefore, are within the reason of the remedy; and ought to be so adjudged, unless the obvious, plain, and literal sense of the words forbid it. If we attend to the words, we find them to be express, positive, free from ambiguity, and without room for such implied expressions: \u201cThe judicial, power of the United States shall extend to extend to controversies between a state and citizens of another state.\u201d If the Constitution really meant to extend these powers only to those controversies in which a State might be Plaintiff, to the exclusion those in which citizens had demands against a State, it is inconceivable that it should have attempted to convey that meaning in words, not only so incompetent, but also repugnant to it; if it meant to exclude a certain class of these controversies, why were they not expressly excepted; on the contrary, not even an intimation of such intention appears in any part of the Constitution. It cannot be pretended that where citizens urge and insist upon demands against a State, which the State refuses to admit and comply with, that there is no controversy between them. If it is a controversy between them, then it cleanly falls not only within the spirit, but the very words of the Constitution. What is it to the cause of justice, and how can it effect the definition of the word controversy, whether the demands which cause the dispute, are made by a against citizens of another State, or by the latter againsthe former? When power is thus extended to a controversy, it necessarily, as to all judicial purposes, is also extended to those, between whom it subsists.\nThe exception contended for, would contradict and do violence to the great and leading principles of a free and equal national government, one of the great objects of which is, to ensure justice to all: To the few against the many, as well as to the many against the few. It would be strange, indeed, that the joint and equal sovereigns of this country, should, in the very Constitution by which they professed to establish justice, to far deviate from the plain path of equality and impartiality, as to give to the collective citizens of one State, a right of suing individual citizens of another State, and yet deny to those citizens a right of suing them. We find the same general and comprehensive manner of expressing the same ideas, in a subsequent clause; in which the Constitution ordains, that \u201cin all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.\u201d Did it mean here party-Plaintiff? If that only was meant, it would have been easy to have found words to express it. Words are to be understood in their ordinary and common acceptation, and the word party being in common usage, applicable both to Plaintiff and Defendant, we cannot limit it to one of them in the present case. We find the Legislature of the United States expressing themselves in the like general and comprehensive manner; they speak in the 13th section of the judicial act, of controversies where a State is a party, and as they do not impliedly or expressly apply that term to either of the litigants, in particular, we are to understand them as speaking of both. In the same section they distinguish the cases where Ambassadors are Plaintiffs, from those in which Ambassadors, are Defendants, and make different provisions respecting those cases; and it is not unnatural to suppose, that they would in like manner have distinguished between cases where a State was Plaintiff, and where a State was Defendant, if they had intended to make any difference between them; or if they had apprehended that the Constitution had made any difference between them.\nI perceive, and therefore candor urges me to mention, a circumstance, which seems to favor the opposite side of the question. It is this: the fame section of the Constitution, which extends the judicial power to controversies \u201cbetween a State and the citizens of another State,\u201d does also extend that power to contreversies to which the United States are a party. Now, it may be said, if the word party comprehends both Plaintiff and Defendant, it follows, that the United States may be sued by any citizen, between whom and them there may be a controversy. This appears some to be fair reasoning; but the same principles of candour which urge me to mention this objection, also urge me to suggest an important difference between the two cases. It is this: in all cases of a actions against States or individual citizens, the National Courts are supported in all their legal and Constitutional proceedings and judgments, bthe arm of the Executive power of the United Slates but in cases of actions against the United States, there is no power which the Courts can call to their aid. From this distinction important conclusions are deducible, and they place the cafe of a State, and the case of the United States, in very different points of view.\nI wish the State of society was so far improved, and the science of Government advanced to such a degree of perfection, as that the whole nation could in the peaceable course of law, be compelled to do justice, and be sued by individual citizens. Whether that is, or is not, now the case, ought not to be thus collaterally and incidentally decided: I leave it a question.\nAs this opinion, though deliberately formed, has been hastily reduced to writing between the intervals of the daily adjournments, and while my mind was occupied and wearied by the business of the day, I fear it is less concise and connected than it might otherwise have been. I have made no references to cases, because I know of none that are not distinguishable from this cafe; nor does it appear to me necessary to shew that the sentiments of the best writers on Government and the rights of men, harmonize with the principles which direct my judgment on the present question. The acts of the former Congresses, and the acts of many of the State Conventions, are replete with similar ideas, and to the honor of the United States, it may be observed, that in no other country are subjects of this, kind better, if so well, understood. The attention and attachment of the Constitution to the equal rights of the people are discernable in almost every sentence of it; and it is to be regretted that the provision in it which, we have been considering, has not in every instance received the approbation and acquiescence which it merits. Georgia has in strong language advocated the cause of republican equality: and there is reason to hope that the people of that State will yet perceive that, it would not have been consistent with that equality, to have exempted the body of her citizens from that suability, which they are at this moment exercising against citizens of another State.\nFor my own part, I am convinced that the sense in which I understand and have explained the words \u201ccontroversies between States and citizens of another State,\u201d is the true sense. The extension of the judiciary power of the United States to such controversies, appears to me to be wife, because it is honest, and because it is useful. It is honest, because it provides for doing justice without respect of persons, and by securing individual citizens as well as States, in their respective rights, performs the promise which every free Government makes to every free citizen, of equal justice and protection. It is useful, because it is honest, because it leaves not even the most obscure and friendless citizen, without means of obtaining justice from a neighbouring State; because it obviates occasions of quarrels between States on account of the claims of their respective citizens; because it recognizes, and strongly rests on this great moral truth, that justice is the same whether due from one man or a million, or from a million to one man; because it teaches and greatly appreciates the value of our free republican national Government, which places all our citizens on an equal footing, and enables each and every of them to obtain justice without any danger of being overborne by the weight and number of their opponents; and, because it brings into action, and enforces this great and glorious principle, that the people are the sovereign of this country, and confequently that fellow citizens and joint sovereigns cannot be degraded by appearing with each other in their own Court's to have their controversies determined. The people have reason to prize and rejoice in such valuable privileges; and they ought not to forget, that nothing but the free courfe of Conilitutional law and Government can ensure the continuance and enjoyment of them.\nFor the reasons before given, I am clearly of opinion, that a State is suable by citizens of another State; but left I should be understood in a latitude beyond my meaning, I think it necessary to subjoin this caution, viz, That such suability may nevertheless not extend to all the demands, and to every kind of action; there may be exceptions. For instance, I am far from being prepared to say that an individual may sue a State on bills of credit issued before the Constitution was esltblished, and which were issued and received on the faith of the State, and at a time when no ideas or expectations of judicial interposition were entertained or contemplated.\nThe following order was made\nBy the Court.\nIt is ordered, that the Plaintiff in this cause do file his declaration on or before the first day of March next.\nOrdered, that certified copies of the said declaration be served on the Governor and Attorney General of the State of Georgia, on or before the first day of June next.\nOrdered, that unless the said State shall either in due form appear, or snew cause to the contrary in this Court, by the first day of next Term, judgment by default shall be entered against the said State.\n*\nTHE Court being met, a commission appointing William Paterson, one of the Justices, bearing, date the 4th of March, 1793, was read; and he was qualified according to law.\n\u2020\n* Ant. b.\n* Som, Sup. c. 3.\n* Ait. i. s, T -\u00cdr\u00ed. 3.-'r. 3.

Can the State of Georgia, being one of the. United Sta:es of America, be mafic a party-defendant in any cafe, in the Supreme Court of the United States, at the fuit of a private citizen, even although he himfelf is, and his teftator was, a a citizen of the State of' South-Carolina ?\n2d.

Is the fervice of the fummons upon the Governor and Attorney General of the State of Georgia, a competent fer-vice ?\n4th. By what procefs ought the appearance of the State of Georgia to be enforced ?\nifl. The Con\u00edlitution and Judicial Law are the fources from which the jurifdicticn of .the Supreme Court is derived. The effedlive paffages in the Con\u00edlitution are in the ihcond lection of the third article. ,c The judicial power fhall extend to controverfies between a State and citizens of another State\u201d <c In cafes, in which a State fhall be a party, the Supreme Court ihall have original jurifdidtion.\u201d The judicial a\u00a3l thus organizes the jurifdidlion, delineated by the Con\u00edlitution. \u201c The.Supreme Court fhall have exclusive jurifdidtibn of all controverfies of a civil nature, where a State is a party, except between a State and its citizens ; and except, alfo, between a State and citizens of other States and aliens, in which latter cafe, it fhall have original, but not exclufive jurifdic. tion.\u201d\nUpon this bails we contend,\nif}. That the Con\u00edlitution veils a jurifdidlion in the Supreme Court over a State,_ as a defendant, at the fuit of a private citizen of another State.\nid. That the judicial a\u00a3l recognizes that jurifdidlion:\nijh The Con\u00edlitution veils a jurifdidlion in the Supreme Court over a State, as a defendant, at the fuit of a private citizen of another State. Confult the letter of the Con\u00edlitution, or rather the influential words of the claufe in queition. The judicial power is extended to controverfies between a State and citizens of another State. I pafs over the word, \u00ab between/' as in no relpect indicating who is to be Plaintiff or who Defendant. Jn the fucceeding paragraph, we read a comment on theie words, when it is faid, that in cafes, in which a State fhall be a party, the Supreme Court fhall have original jurifdiction. Is not a defendimt a party as well as a plaintiff? If authority be neceflary for fo notorious a definition, recur to 1 Harr. Chan. Praff. p. 35. where it is obferved, that. \u201c this Court,\u201d that is, in the High Court of Chancery. of England, \u201c fuits are generally commenced, profecuted, and defended by parties, in their own names only.\u20197 I- might appeal too to a work of greater folemnity, and of greater obligation ; the articles of confederation. In defcribffig the mode, by which differences between two or more States \u00edh\u00e1ll be adjulled, they fpeak of a day to be afiigned for the appearance of thparties ,\u2022 of each party alternately {hiking the names of Ae perfons pro-pofed as Judges ; of either party negle\u00a3ting to attend ; offlrik-ing names in behalf of a party abfent; of any of the parties refuting to fubmit to the authority of the Court; and of lodging the fentence among the acts of Congrefs for the fecurity of the parties concerned. Human genius might be challenged to reilridt thefe words to a plaintiff f\u00edate alone. ( It is indeed truej that according to the order in which the contfoverfies of a State are mentioned, the State is the firfl; and from thence it may be argued, that they mufl be thofe in which a State is firfl named, or plaintiff. Nobody denies, that the citizens of a State may fue Foreign fubjedts, \u00f3r Foreign fubjedls the citizens of a State. And yet, the expreffion of the Conflitution is, c< her tween a State \u00f3r the citizens thereof, and Foreign States, citizens or fubje&s.\u201d The order in. .this inflance, works no difference. In common language too, it would not violate the fub-flantial idea, if a controverfy, faid to be between A. B. and C. D. fhould appear to be between C. D. and A. B. Nay the opportunity fairly occurs in two pages of the judicial article, So' confine fuits to States, as plaintiffs \u2022, but they are both neglected, notwithflanding the confcioufnefs which the convention mufl have poflelfed, that the words, unqualified, ftrongly tended at leaft to fubject States as defendants.\nWith the advantage of the letter on our fide, let us now advert to thefpirit of the. Conflitution, or rather its genuine and necef-fary interpretation. I am aware of the danger of going into a wide hiftory of the Conflitution, as a guide of conflrudlion; and of the Hill greater danger of laying any important ftrefs upon the preamble as-explanatory of its powers. I refort, therefore, to the body of it; which fhews that there may be various adlions of States which are to be annulled. If, for example, -a State fhall fufpend the priviledge of a writ of habeas corpus, unlefs when in cafes of rebellion or invalion the public fafety may require it;fhould pafs a bill of attainder or ex pojl faSlo law ; fhould enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; fhould grant letters of marque and reprifal ; fhould coin money ; fhould emit bills of credit; fhould make any. thing but . gpld and filver coin a tender in payment of debts , ffiould pafs a-law impairing the obligation of contracts ; ihould, without the confent of Congrefs, lay impofts or duties on imports or exports, with certain exceptions; ihould, without the confent of Congrefs, lay- any duty on tonnage, or keep troops or ihips of war m time of peace ; thefe are exprefsly prohibited by the \u25a0Conftitution ; and thus is announced to the world the probability, but certainly the apprehenfion, that States may injure individuals in their property, their liberty, and their lives; may oppyefs lifter .States and may aft in derogation of the general fovereigrlty.\nAre States then to enjoy the high priviledge of acting thus eminently wrong, without controul ; or does a remedy exift ? The love of morality would lead us to with that fome-check ihould be found ; if the evil, which flows from it, be not too great for the good contemplated. The common law has. eftabliihed a principle, that no prohibitory- act {hall be without its vindicatory quality 5 or, in other words, that the infraction of a prohibitory law,, although an exprefs penalty be omitted, is ftill puniihable. Government i\u2019tfelf would be ufelefs, if a plehfure to obey or tranfgrefs with- impunity ihould be fubfti-tuted in the place of a fanCtion to its laws. This was a juft caufe of complaint againft the deceafed confederation. In our folicitude for a remedy, we meet with no difficulty, where the ConduCt of a State can be animadverted on through the medium of an individual. For initance, without fuing a State, a perfon arrefted may be liberated by babeas corpus -, a perfon at-tainted and a ConviCt under an ex pofl jado law, may be faved ; thofe, who offend againft improper treaties, may be protected, or who execute them, may be puniihed ; the aCtors under letters of marque and reprifal may be mulcted ; coinage, bills of credit, unwarranted tenders, and the impairing of contracts between individuals, may be annihilated. But this redrefs goes only half way ; as fome of the preceeding unconftitutional actions muft pafs without cenfure, unlefs States can be made defendants. What is to he done, if 'in confeque\u00f1ce of a bill of attainder, or an cx pofl the c\u00edtate of a citizen fhall be confifcated, and depofited in the treafury-of a State? What, if a State ihould adulterate or coin money below .the-Congreffi-onal ftandard, emit bills of credit, or enaCt unconftitutional. tenders, for the purpofe of extinguiihing its own debts ? What-,if -a State ihould impair her own contracts ? Thefe evils, and others which might be enumerated like them, cannot be corrected without a fuit againft the State. It ia not denied, that one State may be fued by another; and the reafon would feem to be the fame, why an individual, who .is aggrieved, ihould fue the State aggrieving., .A diftinCtion between the cafes is. fupportable only on a. fuppofed comparame inferiority of the-Plaintiff. But, the framers of the Conffitution could never have thought thus.- They muff have viewed human rights in their effence, not in their mere form. They had heard, feen\u2014-I will fay -felt; that Legiflators were not fo far fublhnetl above other men, as' to foar beyond the region of paffion. -Unfledged as America was in the vices off old Governments, flie had fome incident to her own new fituation : individuals had been viftims to the oppreflion of States.\nThefe doctrines are moreover juftified : ifl. By the relation in which the States ftand to the Federal Government: and* 2d. By the law of nations, on the fubject of fuing fovereigns ; and, 3d. They are not weakened by any fuppofed embarrafiment attending the mode of executing a.decree againft a State.\nifl. I acknowledge,, and ihall always - contend, that the States are fovereignties. But with the free will, arifing from abfolute independence, they might combine in Government for their own happinefs. Hence fprang the confederation ; under which indeed the States retained their exemption from the fo renlic jurifdidUon of each .other, and, except under a peouliai modification, of the .United States themfelves. Nor could this be otherwife ; lince fuch \u00e1 jurifdi\u00e9Hon was no where (according to the language of that inffrument) exprefsly delegated.. This Government of fupplication cried aloud for its own reform 5 and the public mind of America decided, that it m'uft periih of stfelf, and that the Union would be thrown into jeopardy, un-lefs the energy of the general fy item fhould be increaled. Then, it was the pr\u00e9fent Conffitution produced a new order of things. It derives its origin immediately from the people ; and the people individually are, under certain limitations, fubjedl to the legiflative, executive, and judicial authorities thereby eftablifli-ed. The States are in fafft affemblages of. thefe individuals who are liable to procefs. The limitations, which the Fedea deral Government -is admitted to impofe upon their powers, are diminutions of fovereignty, at leaft equal to the making of them defendants. It is not pretended, however, to- deduce from th\u00e9fe arguments alone, the amenability of States to judicial cognizance ; but the refultis, that there is nothing in the nature of fovereignties, combined as thofe of America are, to prevent the words of the Conffitution, if they naturally mean, what I have affertfed, from receiving an eafy and ufual conftruction. But purfue. the idea a ftep farther; and trace one, out of a multitude of examples, in which the General Government may be convulfcd to its center without this judicial -power, if a State ihall injure an individual of another State, the latter muff protedt him by a remonftrance. What if this be ineffectual ? To ftop there would Cancel his allegiance ; one Stale cannot fue another for fuch a caufs.j asquiefcence is not be believed. The creft.of war is next raifed; the Federal head cannot remain unmoved amidft thefe. ihocks to the public harmony. Ought then a neccjjity to be created for drawing out the general force on an occafion lb replete with horror ? Is not an adjuftment by a judicial form far preferable ? Are not peace and concord among the States two of the great ends of the Conftitution ? To be confident, the opponents of my prirw ciples mull fay, that a State, may not be'fued by a foreigner.\u2014 What? Shall the tranquillity of our country be at the mercy of every- State ? Or, if it be allowed, that a State may be fu- . ed hy a foreigner, why, in the fcale of reafon, may not the, .meafure be the fame, when the citizen of another State is the complainant ? Nor is the hiftory of confederacies wholly deficient in analogy ; although a very ftridf one is fcarcely to be expected. A parade of deep refearch into the Amphy\u00a3tionic Councii, or the Achican league, would be fruitlefs, from the dearth of hiftorical monuments. With the. belt lights they would probably be found, not to be pofitively identical with\u2019our union. So little did they approach to a National Government, that they might well be deftitute of a common judicatory. So ready were the ancient Governments to merge the injuries to individuals in a State quarrel, and fo certain was it, that any judicial-decree muft have.been enforced by arms, that the mild form of a legal difcuflion could not but be viewed with indifference, if not contempt. And yet it would not be extravagant to conjeiture, that all civil, caufes were fuftained before the Am-phybtionic Council.\n*\nWhat we know- of the Achaean confederacy, exhibits it as purely national,Aar rather confolidated.\u2014 ..They had common Magiftrates taken hy rotation, from the towns ; and the amenability of the conftituent cities to fome Supreme Tribunal, is as probable as otherwife. But, in fact, it would be a wafte of time, to dwell upon thefe obfcurities. To catch all the femblauces of confederacies, fcattered through thehiltoric page, would be no lefs abfurd, than to fearch for light in regions of darknefs, or a (table jurifprudence in the midft of barbarity and bloodlhed. Advancing then, into more modem times, the Helvetic Union prefents itfelf i one of whofe characteriitics ib, that there is no common judicatory. Stanyatt, 117. Nor,- does it obtain in' Holland. = But it cannot be concluded from hence, that the Swifi or the Dutch, the jealbufy of whom would .not fuffer them to adopt ai National Government, would deem it an abafement, to fummon a State, connected as tbe United States are, before a National Tribunal. But our anxiety for precedents is relieved by appealing to the Germanic Empire, The jumble of fifty principalities together no more de-the name of one body, than the incoherent parts of Neluchad-nazzar\u2019s image. The Princes wage war without the confent of their paramount fovereign; they even wage war upon each other j nay upon the Emperor himfelf; after which it will add but little to fay, that they are diftin\u00e9l fovereignties. And, yet both the Imperial Chamber, and the Aulic Council hear and determine the complaints of individuals againft the Princes.\n*\nIt will not furely be required to affign a reafon, why the Confederation did not Convey a Similar jurifdiftion; lince that fcanty and ftrift paper was of fo different a hue and feature from the Conftitution, as fcarcely to appear the .child of the fame family.\nI hold it, therefore, to be no degradation of fovereignty, in the States, to fubmit to the Supreme Judiciary of the United States. At the fame time, by way of anticipating art objeftion, \u00cd affert, that it will not follow, from thefe premifes, that the United States themfelves may be fued- For the head of a confederacy is not within the reach of the judicial authorities of its inferior members. It is exempted by its peculiar pre-eminen-cies. We have indeed known petitions of right, nionftrans ds droit, and even procefs in the Exchequer. But the firft is in the ftyle of intreaty ;\u2022 the fecond, being apparent upon the record, is fo far a .dedu&ion from the royal title \u215c the third, as in the. banker\u2019s cafe in the 1 ith volume of the State trials, is applicable only, where the charge is claimed againft the Revenue ; and all of them are widely remote from an involuntary fubjedtion, of the fovereign to the cognizance of his own Courts.\n2d. But what if the high independency of diffevered nations remained uncohtrouled among the United States, fo far as to place the individual States no more within the fphere of the Supreme Court, than one independent nation is within the jurifdidtion of another ? It has been a conteft amongft civilians, whether one Prince found within the territory of another, may be fued for a contradi.\u2020 I do not affert the affirmative ; but it is allowable to obferve, that fuch a pofition, once conceded, would il-luftrate and almoft fettle the prefent inquiry. But the fame author, who repudiates the former idea, is ttrenuous in the opinion, that where the ejfeSis, or property, of one Prince are refted in the dominions of another, the proprietor Prince may be fummoned before a tribunal of that other. Now, although, each State has its feparate territory, in one fenfe, the whole is that of the United States, in another. The jurifdiilion of this Court reaches to Georgia, as well as to Philadelphia. If therefore, the procefs could be Commenced in rem, the author't7 \u00b0f Bjnkajhoek would juftify us ; and whether it be com* menced in ran, or in perfonam, the principle of amenability is equally avowed.\n3d. Nor will thefe fentiments be weakened by the want of a fpecial provifion in the Conftitution for an execution ; fince it is fo provided in no cafe, not even where States are in litigation. This will be more properly arranged under the foh lowing head concerning the judicial ad.\nII. t- The judicial ad recognizes the jurifdidion, over States. Inftead of ufing the fhft expreffion in the Conftitution, .to wit, \u201c cantroverfies, between, &c.\u201d it adopts the fecond, namely, \u201c where a State \u00edhall be a party.\u201d Thus it makes n<5 tliftindion between a State as Plaintiff, or as Defendant; but' evidently comprehends in the word (t party\u201d a State, as Defendant in one care at lead, where a State is-oppofed to a State. This, after what has been faid, need, not be further pvefled.\n2- The mafter-objedion is, that the law has preferibed no execution againft a State ; that none can be forfried with propriety ; and chat, therefore, a judgment againft a State mult be abortive. It is true, that no exprefs execution is given by the judicial ad or the procefs ad. But has it ever been infinuat-ed,' that a difpute between two States is not within Federal cognizance, becaufe no execution is marked out ? Or, that for a iilcereafon, the Court, given by the confederation, could not proceed ?\nThe Supreme Court are either veiled with authority by the judicial ad, to form an execution, or poflefs it as incidental to their jurifdidion. By the 14th fedion of the judicial ad,' the Supreme Court, as one of the Courts of the United States, has power to iffue writs of fire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs, not fpecially provided for by th\u00e9flatule, which inay be nccef-firy for the exercife of'their refpeclive jurifdictions, and agreeable id the principles and vfiges of law. Executions for one State againft another, are writs' not fpecially provided for by \u00edlatuire, and ar\u00e9 neceflary -for the exercife of the jurifdidion of the Supreme Courts, ina conteft between States; and although, in neither the common law, nor any ftatute^the form of fuch an execution appears ; yet is it agreeable' to the principles and ufages of law, that there \u00edhou.ld be a mode of carrying into force a jlirif-didion, which is not denied. If then the Supreme Court may create a mode of execution, when a Stpte is defeated at law by a State, why may not the fame means be exerted where an individual is fuccefsful againft a State ? Again : The procefs-ad, which didates the modes of execution to the other Courts, is filent as-to the Supreme Court ; it mull, therefore,. be cither wholly without executions, or derive them from the foregoing fedion of the judicial ad, or adopt them, on- the grounduf incidental power. The total negation of execution is. obviouily inadmiffible ; and the eonftru&ion of. the judicial act,, which has been juft infilled on, would be fufficiently efficacious. But why may net executions even fpriim from the will of the Supreme Court, as the writs of fieri facias,. levari facias, and dijiringas were originally the creation of Courts? Such an'incidental authority is not of a higher tofte than that of fine and imprifonment, which belongs to every Court of record, without a particular grant of it. But what fpecies of execution can be devifed ? This, though, a difficult talk, is not impracticable. And if it were incumbent on 4ne to anticipate the mea- ' fures of the Court, I would fuggelt thefe .outlines, of conduit. Firft, that if the judgment be for the fpecific thing,, it may be feized : or, 'fecondly, if for damages, fuch property may be taken,, as,' upon the\u2019principles, and under the circumftances cited ftom Bynhetfkoek.> WQuld.be the groundwork of jurifdiition over a fovereign Prince. However,\u2018it is.of.no ccnfequence, whether the conjeiturea.be accurate or notj. as a correct plan can doubtlefs be difeovered.\nStill we may be prefled with the final queftion : \u00a3t- What if the State is refolved to oppofe the execution ?\u201d This would be an awful <jueft-iqn indeed! He, to whofe lpt it fhould fall, to folve it, would be impelled to invoke the god of wifdom, to illuminate his decifion. I will not believe that he would fecal \u25a0the tremendous examples of vengeance, which in paft days have been in\u00f1i\u00edted by thofe who claim, againft thefe .who violate, authority. I will not believe that in the wide and gloomy thea.-tre, over which his eye fhould roll, he might perchance catch a diftant glimpfe of the Federal arm uplifted. Scenes like thefe are too full of horror, not to agitate, not to rack, the imagination. - But at laft we muft fettle on this refult ; there are many duties,. pr.ecifely defined,, which the States, muft perform. Let the remedy which is to be adminiftered, if thefe fhould be difobeyed, \u215b the remedy on the occafion, which.we con-template. The argument requires no more to be faid : itfurer ly does not require us to dwell on fuch painful poffibilities. Rather, let me hope and pray, .that not a fingle ftar in the America<; Conftellation will ev.er fufier its luftre to be .diminifhed by hoftility againft the fentence of a. Cpurt, which itfelf has adopted.\nBut, after ail, although nomodfe of execution fliould be in-, vented, why fliall not the Court proceed to judgment ? It\u2018 is-well-known, that the Courts of &me'Stat\u00a3S..hav.e been directed \u215c render judgment, and. there ftop and that the Chancery has often tied up the hand? of - the- common law in a like manner. Perhaps, if a Government-could beccmftkuted without' mingling at all the three orders of power, Courts fhould, in.-ftri\u00a3t theory, \u00bfnly declare the lav/ of the cafe, and the fub* je\u00a3l upon which the execution is to be levied ; and fhould leave their opinions to. be enforced by the Executive. But that any State fhould refufc to conform t\u00f3 a folemrt determination of the Supreme Court of the Union, is impoffible, until fire fhall abandon her love of peace, fidelity to compact, and cha-radler.\nCombine .then into one view, the letter and the fpirit of the Conftitution ; the relation of the feveral. States to the union of the States ; the precedents from other fovereignties; the judicial a\u00a3t, and procefs adt; the power of forming executions 5 the little previous importance of this power to that of rendering of judgment ; the influence under which every State mull be to maintain the general harmony x and the inference, will, 1 truft, be in favor. \u25a0 of the firft propofition; namely, that a State may be fued by the citizen of another State.\nII. The next queftion is, whether an. adlion of affimpfit will lie againft a State ? I acknowledge, that it does not follow from a State being fuable in fome actions, that ihe is liable in every adlion.- But that of ajjinnpfit is of all others moil free fi$m cavil. Is not a State capable of making a prortiife ? Certainly ; as a State is a moral perfon, being an afiemblage of' individuals, who are moral perfons. Vat.. B- \\ J. 1. On this ground, treaties and other compacts, are daily concluded between nations. On this ground the United States and the particular States have moved during and lince the war. On this ground the Conftitution tranfmitted from the old to the new Government all the obligations of the former. Without it every Government muft ftagnate. But I fhall enter into this matter no further, as it is open for difeuffioa in almoft every ftage of the caufc.\nIII. I affirm in the third place, that the fervice of the fum-mons on the Governor and Attorney-General, is a competent fer-vice.' The fervice of procefs is folely for the purpofe of notice to prepare for defence. The mode, if it be not otherwife pre-feribed bylaw, or long ufage, is in the diferetion of the Court ; and hfere that diferetion muft operate. The defence muft reft either upon the three branches of Government colledtively, or one of them. But, as the judiciary are manifeftly disjoined from fuch an office, and (he legiflative are only to provide funds to anfwer damages, the pmct'ice of confidering the Executive, as the o\u00edknfible repiielentative \u00f3f a State, devolves upon it this fundlion. In the in\u00edt\u00e1nce of Georgia, her Conftitution efta-blifhes the Governor as the channel of communication With the LegiflatuTe ; he is bound by oath to defend her; and he has inftituted a fuit,- now depending in this Court, in her behalf, againft BraUsfrd, and others. It was fupererogation to ferve' \u215b\u215b procefs on the Attorney-General; although this has fatisfi-ed even etiquette-itfelf, by notifying the officer, who is the in-ilrument of defence.\nIV. .As to the fteps, proper for compelling an appearancej thefe- too, not being dictated by law,, are in the breail of the Court. I banifh the comparifon of States with corporations ; and, therefore, fearch for ho refemblance in them. I prefer the fcheme contained in the motion j becaufe it tempers with moderation the preliminary meafurcs ; and po\u00edlp\u00f3nes embar-raffments, at any rate, until the clofe of\"the bufinefs. It is un-neceffary to fpend time on this hear! ; as the mode is to me abfolutely indifferent if it be effectual, and. r\u00e9fpe\u00f1ful.\nWith this difcuffion, though purely legal, it will be impoffi-ble to prevent the world from blending political confiderations. Some may call this.an aterapt to co'nfolidate. \u2019 But before Tuch an imputation fhali be pronounced, let them examine well, if the fair interpretation of the Conflitution does hot vindicate my opinions. \u2019 Above all, let me perfonally allure them, that the proflration of State-rights is no objedl with me 3 but that I remain in perfedt \u2018confidence, that with the power, which the .people and the Legiflatures of the States indiredlly holdover almoit every movement of the National Government, the States need not fear an aflault from bold ambition, or. any approaches of covered ftratagem. .,\nThe Court held the cafe under advifement,. from the 5th to the 18th of February, when they delivered their opinions feriatim.\n* See Anacbarsis,' 3 VoL fi. 300.\n* See Hist, of Germanic- Body, />. t 5 7. 8, liynk. e, 3. c. 4."}}}, {"id": 11749399, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11749399/", "name": "Oswald, Administrator, versus the State of New-York", "name_abbreviation": "Oswald v.

Atty.,\nThe defendant, a consul from Genoa, was indicted for a misdemeanor, in sending anonymous and threatening letters to Mr. Hammond, the British minister, Mr. Holland, a citizen of Philadelphia, and severiil other persons, with a view to extort money.\nBefore the defendant pleaded, his counsel (Heatly, Lewis & Dallas) moved to quash the indictment, contending that to the supreme court of the United States, belonged the exclusive cognizance of the case, on account of the defendant\u2019s official character. By the second section of the third article of the constitution, it is expressly declared, that \u201cin all eases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction.\u201d By declaring in the sequel of the same section \u201cthat in all the other cases before mentioned the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction,\u201d the word original is rendered tantamount to exclusive, in the specified cases. But surely an original jurisdiction established by the constitution in the. supreme court, cannot be exclusively vested by law in any inferior courts.

That the matter charged in the indictment was not a crime by the Common Law, nor is it made such by any positive Law of the United States. In England it was once Treason ; it is now felony ; but in both instances it was the effect of positive law.

By the 2d section of the 3d article of the Constitution, it is expressly declared, that, \u201c in all cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers, and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.\" By declaring in the sequel of the same section \u201c that in all the other cases before mentioned the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction,\u201d the word original is rendered tantamount to exclusive, in the specified cases. But surely an original jurisdiction established by the Constitution in the Supreme Court, cannot be exclusively vested by law in any inferior Courts. The 13th section of the judicial act provides, that \" the Supreme Court shall have exclusively all such jurisdiction of suits or proceedings against Ambassadors, or other public Ministers, or their domestics, or domestic servants, as a Court of Law can have or exercise confidently with the law of nations; and original, but not exclusive, jurisdiction of all suits brought by Ambassadors, or other public Ministers, or in which a Consul, or Vice-Consul shall be a party.\u201d This provision obviously respects civil suits; but the 11th sect. declares, that \u201c the Circuit Court shall have exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority of the United States, except where this act otherwise provides, or the laws of the United States shall otherwise direct, and concurrent jurisdiction with the District Courts of the crimes arid offences cognizable therein.\u201d This is a criminal prosecution, not otherwise provided for ; and if the jurisdiction can be exclusively vested in the Circuit Court, it destroys the original jurisdiction given by the Constitution to the Supreme Court.

But the jurisdiction of this court is limited, as to persons; and therefore should be shewn, as well as that of a court, whose jurisdiction is limited, as to locality and extent. The common law authorities all shew that jurisdiction should be averred; and though they may sometimes seem to differ, yet the whole difference in any of them, is, only, what amounts to a sufficient averment, on which the authorities do not agree. Now the only difference between those cases and that at bar is, that those were inferior courts, and this a superior court: and therefore it may be argued that the cases in the former turned upon the inferiority of the court; but that argument is not satisfactory.

The question, in all of them, was concerning the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts, where the actions were brought. For being inferior courts, the superior courts at Westminster, confined them ; both because derogatory to the common law, and for the sake of the venue. This, therefore, is a novel objection, and must stand on its own reasons. Some persons may sue here, others cannot. Therefore the defendant must point out the disability; for the court will not enquire into circumstances, unless he shews it.

But, after issue joined on the merits, they will not receive proof of residence, or other disability; but, of the subject matter in dispute, only. For the plea answers the allegations with respect to the debt, and not of the person.

That, after receiving the pilot on board, she continued her course until she arrived within two miles of Cape Henry, in five fathoms water, and as near the shore as the pilot thought proper to go; when she was seized by a number of armed men, under the command of Peter Johannene, captain of the schooner Citizen Genet, and bearing the national colours of France, as a prize, and the captain and crew made prisoners.

That the treaty between France and the United States, in its 17th article, forbids any examination of the lawfulness of prizes taken by either party when at war, by the officers, which include judges or courts, of the other; and that such prizes may enter into the ports of either party, and depart at pleasure, without search or any impediment; and that this court should immediately stay proceedings when the commission is produced under which the capture in question was made. 2. That, by the laws of nations, to which the treaty is conformable, a neutral nation has no right to be the judge, either of the lawfulness of the war between belligerent powers, or of their conduct towards each other in the prosecution of hostilities. That undertaking to determine on the question of prize, in this case, would be interposing our judgment not only illegally, but in a manner unprecedented; there being no instance to be found, in which the courts of a neutral nation have ever exercised jurisdiction in such cases. 3. That, by the voluntary law of nations, every war is considered by parties, as well as neutrals, just as between such parties, and all acquisitions lawful. If these acquisitions are disputed, it must be-in the courts of the nation to which the captor belongs, and cannot be the subject of enquiry in those of a neutral nation, even at the instance of the neutral sovereign, much less at the suit of private subjects of one of the belligerent powers, against those of the other. 4. That the right of entry and sale of prizes, in neutral ports, is lawful; and it is sufficient for the neutral that the prize is found in complete possession of one of the powers at war, or their subjects. No judiciary enquiry should be made on the occasion. But if, in the capture, an invasion of the territorial rights of the neuter has been made, it must be canvassed by the diplomatic body, and finally settled by the sovereigns of the neutral and of the belligerent nation whose subjects have done the wrong. It is an offence against the neutral nation, and not an injury to the captured.\nTo shew that the court have jurisdiction in this case, the advocates for the libellant contended: 1. That every sovereign and independent nation has a right to vindicate a wrong done to its dignity, and to repel, and obtain satisfaction for, invasions-of its territory. 2. That the attacking and capturing the vessels of a friend, coming into the ports, or acting in a hostile manner, by one belligerent power against another, within the limits of a nation at peace with both, is a wrong done to the nation so at peace, an insult on its sovereignty, and an invasion of its territorial rights. 3. That we are bound, by the laws of nations, to seek reparation for the wrong thus committed, as well on our own account, as to enable us to give satisfaction to a friendly nation, the property of whose subjects has been taken within our limits. 4. That all captures made within the territories of a neutral, either on land, in. their ports or harbours, or on tfieir coasts to a- certain distance from the land, are unlawful-, and ought by the laws of nations to be restored. 5. That the word \u201cprizes\u201d in the treaty means \u201clawful prizes,\u201d and illegal captures are as none, so far as relates to the subject matter of the treaty, and, therefore, were not the objects of the contracting parties, at the time of making it: and it could not have been the meaning of the treaty to let captures in a neutral country pass without enquiry. 6. That this is not judging of the war between the neutral x>owers; it is an en \u2022 quiry into an allegation of an invasion of territorial rights. Every nation is: obliged to take care of its own preservation; it has a right to prevent any other injuring its security, and may- make use of force to retaliate-injustice, to prevent injury to its territory, and to punish the invaders- of Its privileges.-7. That we are bound by treaty to be at peace with the sovereign whose subjects and their property have been captured, and, unless-restoration is made, and the property of these subjects protected, our engagements may be considered as violated. We are also bound to protect and defend the ships and merchandise of Prussia, Holland and Sweden, if attacked on our coasts, &c. and if captures take place, to use our endeavours to cause restitution to be made. 8. That the best mode of causing restitution is through the courts of admiralty, by process in.rem, when the capture is within their power. These courts proceed according to the laws of nations, and, in a government like ours, are the only tribunals that can properly be applied to. In despotic sovereignties, force may immediately be applied; but here ours is a government of laws, and our executive is not vested with the authority exercised by sovereigns in such cases. All he can do is to represent and negoc\u00edate, and his representations may be slighted, and our government treated with indignity. If there is no power in this court to effectuate the purpose required, it does not exist any where. The reason why cases of admiralty adjudications and interferences cannot be produced, is that captures have seldom been carried into the ports of the injured neutral. And those who commit these outrages will take care not to-put the property into the power of the injured, unless it shall appear they can do it with impunity. If they can dispose of their prizes here, they will not go to their own courts to have them condemned. 9. That though it is true that a remedy may be applied by negotiation and diplomatic discussion, and ultimately by force, yet the remedy through the courts of admiralty jurisdiction is a concurrent one. It is also the less liable to objection, as these are courts regulated by the laws and customs of all nations, and not liable to political bias, or entangled in political considerations. They are also courts, to whose decisions, for reciprocal benefit, all nations pay a particular respeet\nI have given this subject every considerar tion I am- capable of, and have deliberated on the arguments and authorities brought forward by the advocates on both sides the question, with the attention they justly merit. But it seems to me that much has been said not immediately applicable to the only point I have now to determine, to wit: Whether this court is vested with the power to enquire into the legality of the prize, and to investigate the fact on which all the rea-sonings are founded? If this fact is established, and the extent of our territorial limits ascertained, so as to make it clear that a capture has been made within the territories of the United States, there is not a doubt but that a flagrant violation of the rights of neutrality has been committed. Vatell, 1. 3, \u00a7 132; Lee, c. 9, p. 151. And this is followed by- many of the consequences mentioned by the advocates for the libel-lants, so far as they respect our national dignity and duty towards a friendly power, in endeavouring- to cause restitution or recom-pence to be made. Nor does this seem to be denied by the other side of the question. But the embarrassment still exists. Who is to enquire into the matter, and either give or attempt the redress? It is difficult for a neutral nation, with the best dispositions, so to conduct itself as not to displease one or the other of belligerent parties, heated with the rage of war, and jealous pf even common acts of justice or friendship on its part. Neither is it easy for the nations at war to restrain their subjects from acts of violence, even in the territories of their friends. The least under control are those whose object is not honourable conflict, or patriotic exertion. These are actuated by'a spirit of lucre, which not only incites to plunder the base and lawless freebooter, but tarnishes even heroism, by seducing into unjustifiable actions the bravest men. It would be for the interest of nations, and the happiness of mankind, if, by universal consent, the quarrels of nations were prevented from being turned to the purposes of private advantage. But tho swords of those who fight for gain will not, in our day, be beaten into ploughshares. We must take nations and men as we find them, and consider as lawful what those at war authorize, so far as - it respects the parties engaged. After all, it depends much on the interest, the convenience, or the good temper of governments, whether a neutral shall or shall not be engaged in war. A prudent and just conduct, on the part of the neutral particularly, is the surest preventive. But how to evidence this, is a matter of consideration with those to whom the government is delegated. The simplest mode of evincing our impartial disposition, is to confine ourselves to the customs of other nations in our predicament; an over anxious zeal to avoid contests may otherwise lead us into errors; and\u00bb while we are endeavouring to avoid one rock, we may- split on another. Mutual toleration must be exercised; for those who are at war, and those who are not) have their share of difficulties on this subject Under this view of the matter be-, fore me, I have given a patient hearing to both sides; and have particularly attended to the arguments by which it has been en-deavoured to establish a jurisdiction in this coui-t. It must certainly be allowed, by the advocates for the libellants, that they have not been able to shew any direct authority upon the point. For the two cases of the Duke of Tuscany (T ee, 131) seizing the vessel committing the outrage near the port of Leghorn, and that of the king of England (Bynk. c. 8, p. 177; Molloy, 85) ordering restitution, of-the effects taken out of the housesof the inhabitants, and\u2018belonging to a ship of a friendly power, driven by its enemy on bis shore, appear to have been acts of power and not done in consequence of decrees or orders of courts of admiralty. Yet these jurisdictions existed, in both the countries above mentioned. The case of Captain Landy, in-the American frigate- Alliance, who was ordered by the court of France to restore a ship taken by him, is not in point (2 Code de Pris, p. 877), for the Forsters, who appeared as owners, were either subjects of,, or persons resident and domiciliated in, France, and the ship was sailing under a passport of that nation. They, therefore, could not be considered as enemies; and, the capture not being made from enemies, the case was- not comprehended in the treaty, or the capture authorized- by the laws of nations. In the case falling under the notice of the king of England (except that of his having the powers of peace and war, as an appendage to which he might have exercised this kind of authority) I should not have supposed him vested, without an act of the legislature, with the authority he used; and it is doubted, by Bynkershoek, whether he did right in interfering at all on the occasion. If it be consistent with treaties, and otherwise right, our legislature can vest the executive in future with similar powers. I should suppose, too, that the liberty of selling prizes, in a neuti\u2019al country, is not a perfect right; and may also be considered, by our national legislature, as a subject of regulation. If any captures are made within our limits, and the vessels or plunder is brought within our ports, the sale may be forbidden. They must then be either abandoned or carried within the jurisdiction of the captors, where the proper courts will consider of their legality. Yet this is a matter, not of judicial, but political arrangement; and must be left to those who have the- authority to direct. The sovereignty of our nation is as complete as that of any other; therefore, whatever other sovereigns can do, we have in our power. But because, at this time, the authority, supposed necessary on this occasion, is not. .as it is alleged, to be found in the executive \u25a0branch, I do not see that the judiciary ought to exercise it, as a consequence resulting from political convenience, or the necessity \u2022of the particular case. This, I fear, would \u00a1be a novelty dictated by our zeal, and might give cause of offence to one, while we were .aiming at justice to ourselves, or gratification to the other. I hesitate not to use any plain authority I know this court to possess, let the consequence be what it may; but this is a question too important in its effects, to be acted on but on the surest grounds. I agree here, as I do in many of their other positions, with the advocates for the libel-lants, when they say that \u201ccourts of admiralty jurisdiction are less liable to objection, as these courts are regulated by the laws and customs of all nations, and not liable to political bias, or tentangled in political considerations.\u201d This should induce the greater caution in their determinations. I have not se\u00e9n any proofs that \u201cthe laws and customs of all nations\u201d warrant the interference of this court If they do not no authority can be derived from our own laws, if they were not silent on the subject. In the existing arrangement of our government we did not calculate on our relative situation, as to \u2022contests between other nations. If, for this reason, no immediate remedy is at hand, who can justly censure the executive, when he has given decided evidence of his impartial .and just inclinations? Who can with reason blame the judiciary, if they will not assume a power not conceived to be vested in them? Not the government of the country, whose \u25a0subjects are the libellants, and to whom I wish every degree of justice may be done. The principles established in the decisions \u2022of their own courts, and the opinions of their most celebrated lawyers in the contest with the king of Prussia in the Case of The Silesia Loan, in a great degree reach the point, as to judiciary authority in a neutral nation. In Palachie\u2019s Case, 1 Rolle, 175, I am aware that it is only said the vessel \u201cwas taken \u2022at sea,\u201d but if not, it rather appears, that it would be more proper for a diplomatic than \u2022a judiciary examination. The general principle, as to the capture, is agreed; and is similar to that established in our treaty with France, which ought to have its proper weight 4 Inst. 154. \u201cIt was resolved, by the whole court of king\u2019s bench, upon conference and deliberation, that the Spaniards (.whose ship had been taken by an enemy and brought into England, a friend to both parties) had lost the property of the goods forever, and had no remedy for them in England; and it relied principally upon the book in 2 Rolle, 3, ubi supra, being of so great authority; for, by that book, he that will sue to have restitution of goods robbed at sea, ought by law to prove two things: 1. That the sovereign of the plaintiff was, at the time of the taking, in amity with the king of England. 2. That he who took the goods was, at the time of the taking, in amity with the sovereign of him whose goods were taken: for, if he who took them was in enmity with the sovereign of him whose goods were taken, then was it no depredation or robbery, but a lawful taking, as every enemy might take from another.\u201d It is true that, by the laws and customs of nations, the capture, if taken in neutral bounds, is not lawful prize. Woodeson, 443. But I do not see that this court can get at that circumstance, without holding plea as to the lawfulness of the prize.\nIt is the original question, and not collateral matter, which determines jurisdiction. The courts of common law in England will not take cognizance of anything arising out of the question, prize or no prize (Le Caux v. Eden, Doug. 612), \u201cbecause the original cause must all come into question again:\u201d and yet the admiralty had determined that the ship was no prize. This will be a proper subject of enquiry on the part of our government, or in a court of the country of the captor. Every nation has established these courts, and knowing that, if at war, they are answerable to a nation at peace, or in amity; if violations of territory happen in captures, care is taken to examine into this circumstance. If, on this account, the capture is illegal, it is so adjudged; and the party taking is liable to damages. Whether such damages shall exceed the amount of the security given by commanders of private ships of war, or whether one nation is answerable to another for injuries done by its subjects to others, contrary to or without its orders, is a matter in which there are differences of opinion among civilians (Lee, 226-231, 222; Grotius de J. B. & P. l. 2, c. 17, \u00a7 20), and which it is unnecessary for me now to investigate. It is doubtless contrary to the instructions of the French government, that any of the ships, commissioned by them, act in a hostile manner in a friendly and allied territory. It is to be expected by one power from another, that her courts and her administration will do justice to the rights of sovereignty and neutrality. It will be the more to b\u00e9 lamented if a friend and ally should disappoint this expectation. But, should this be the case, it is not for me to say what proceedings should be had. I have subjoined to this decree some extracts from the \u201cexpositions of the motives, &e.\u201d from the duke of Newcastle, the British minister's letter to Mr. Mitchell, the minister of Prussia, and from the report and opinion of Sir George Lee, Dr. Paul, Sir Dudley Rider and Mr. Murray, the late Lord Mansfield, on the subjects I have mentioned, which are to be found in Magens, 463, 4S2, 4S7, 49.1, 496, 505.\n2\nOther authorities from British and other writers might he added, by which it appears, that when two powers have any difference between them, the affair must he' treated by negotiation, and not through the instrumentality of their courts of justice. That affairs-of prizes are only cognizable in the courts of the power making the capture: these courts-being generally styled courts of admiralty ;\u2022 and, that it never was attempted, before the subject of that controversy happened, to erect in a neutral state courts for the trial of prizes, taken by belligerent powers, even where neutrals were concerned; and that, of course, no court of one sovereign has a right to try the prizes taken by the ships, public or private, of another.\n3\nA dispute of this nature, in which the king of Prussia could not prevail, who, though weak at sea, was-powerful at land, and had a propensity for war, would not very well suit us. We have, indeed, shewn that we know how to make war, but it is now our interest and inclination to cultivate the arts of peace. Much has-been said, on both sides, to shew the importance of this cause, and the necessity of caution in its determination. I am sufficiently impressed with those considerations; but I feel myself at ease in this view of the. subject. I am persuaded that any thing which affects the sovereignty and rights of our country will not be passed unnoticed by those-who have the power to regulate our national concerns. On my own account, I have no disquietude; for no error of mine can affect the nation. There is an appeal, from any determination I may give, to a superior tribunal. I am anxious for the peace and dignity of my country, but not deeming myself authorized to decide in a matter growing out of the com tests between belligerent powers, nor com sidering this court, in this instance, the vindicator of the rights of our nation, I leave in better hands the discussion on the subject of national insult, and the remedy for any invasion of territorial rights.\n4\nThe instance side of this court seems to have other objects1; and a prize court, called into activity when a nation is at peace, appears to be a \u25a0'solecism \u2022' \u25a0in jurisprudence. 1 do, therefore, decree, or-: der and adjudge, that the libel in this cause be dismissed; and that the ship therein mentioned be discharged from the arrest, the plea in this case being relevant.\n2 1 Magens, 505. Each crown has no doubt an equal right to erect admiralty courts for the trial of prizes taken by virtue of their respective commissions, but neither has a right to try the prizes taken by the other, or to reverse the sentences given by the other\u2019s tribunal. The only regular method of rectifying their errors is by appeal to the superior court.\n1 Magens, 491. If a subject of the king of Prussia is injured by, or has a demand upon, any person here, he ought to axiply to your majesty\u2019s courts of justice, which are equally open and indifferent to foreigner or native: so, vice versa, if a subject here is wronged by a person living in the dominions of his Prussian majesty, he ought to apply for redress in the king of Prussia\u2019s courts of justice. If the matters of complaint be a capture at sea, during war, and the question relative to prize, he ought to apply to the judicatures established to try these questions. The law of nations, founded upon justice, equity, convenience and the reason of the thing, and confirmed by long usage, does not allow of reprisals, except in cases of violent injuries, directed or supported by the stale, and justice absolutely denied in re minime dubia, by all the tribunals, and afterwards by the prince. Where the judges are left free, and give sentence according to their conscience, though it should be erroneous, that would be no ground for reprisals. Upon doubtful cases, different men think and judge differently, and all a friend can desire is, that justice should be as impartially administered to him, as it is to the subjects of that prince in whose courts the matter is tried.\n1 Magens, 496. Por as to the Prussian commission to examine these cases ex parte, upon new suggestions, it never was attempted in any country in the world before. Prize or no prize must be determined by courts of admiralty, belonging to the power whose subjects make the capture. Every foreign prince in amity has a right to demand that justice shall be done to his subjects in these courts according to the law of nations, or particular treaties, where any. are subsisting. If, in re minime dubia, these courts proceed upon .foundations directly opposite to the law of nations, or subsisting treaties, the neutral state has a right to complain of such determinations. But there never was, nor ever can be, any other, equitable method of trial. All the maritime nations of Europe have, when at war, from the earliest times, uniformly proceeded in this way with the approbation of the powers at peace.\n1 Magens, 4S7. By the maritime law of nations universally and immemorially received, there is an established method of determination, whether the capture be or be not lawful prize. Before the ship or goods can be disposed of by the captor, there must be a regular judicial proceeding, wherein both parties may be heard, and condemnation thereupon as prize in a court of admiralty, judging by the laws of nations and treaties. The proper and regular court for these condemnations is the court of that state to whom the captors belong.\n1 Magens, 482. First, that affairs of this kind are and can be cognizable only in the courts belonging to that power, where the seizure is made, \u00bfnd consequently that the erecting foreign courts or jurisdictions elsewhere, to take cognizance thereof, is contrary to the known practice of all nations in like cases, and therefore a proceeding which none can admit.\n1 Magens, p. 403, \u00a7 47. When two powers have any difference between them, neither of them can on either side appeal to the laws of the country, because one of the two parties does not acknowledge them. The affair then must be treated in the way of negotiation from court to court, and the difference can only be decided with the consent of both parties according to the laws of nations, or by the means founded thereon.\n3 See on this point the case of The Flad Oyen, 1 C. Rob. Adm. (Philadelphia Ed.) 135, Id. (English Ed.) 137. In the case the question is discussed with great learning and ingenuity by Sir William Scott. See, also, the case The Kierlighett, 3 C. Rob. Adm. (Philadelphia Ed.) 96, Id. (English Ed.) 29.\n4 When this cause was decided, no territorial limits were established by any national act. The facts were not accurately investigated. On-the exhibition of the testimony, it did not appear to me to be clearly ascertained that the place of capture was left -without doubt, as to its distance from the shore. The whole of the case was novel in the United Slates. There is no point on which the writers on maritime laws and privileges so much disagree, as on that of the extent of the territorial rights of the sovi erelgn possessing the shores, into the contiguous sea. All maritime people deem the nation in rightful possession of the coast, sovereign of the adjacent sea; yet there is no general agrees ment as to the nature or extent of this sovereignty. Time has not matured or settled opinions on this subject among jurists; nor have particular compacts established any general principle. From the period of the compilation of the Digest of Justinian, to this day, the point has been uncertain, and open to controversy. Some early commentators on that work assert that the territorial sea extended 60 mil\"\u00bb from the shore. A majority of ancient writ-era carry it to 100 miles. Valin -endeavours to ascertain it by the sounding lead; whether the coast be composed of extensive shallows and flats, or bold and deep shores! Others fix the distance at the point capable of being \u2018defended from the shore. Hubner, the champion of neutral -rights, thinks the limit ought to be the range of a cannon shot; and of this opinion is Bynkershoek, Vattel and other eminent civilians, and among them Azuni; who, in volume 1, pp. 193-208, discusses the point, and cites many authors, and some treaties and documents. It seems to be a claim of power in extent, though of justice in its origin: and when viewed according to the contradictory opinions of writers, it appears difficult, doubtful, and often visionary. It is even left by some to the determination of those, whose wants, or convenience, require a greater or less distance from the shore. Some have need of more sea room for fishing; and it suits others to distinguish between extent for operation of revenue laws, and that for protection of neutral trade; the latter, these say, must be at the greatest distance. The range of a cannon shot is generally accounted about a sea league. Our act of congress (3 i\u00e1tat. 91), fixes that distance, on the maritime territorial limits, for our nation: and gives the district courts jurisdiction to that extent, of captures made in violation of our territorial rights; by the law, passed after the foregoing decree, to wit, in June 1794, as opinions were various on that point, the extent might have been declared greater, without violating the pretensions or just claims of others. There is no doubt of the right (if they have the power) of any nation, to forbid and prevent captures, at a greater distance than the sea league from their coast. Nor can it be fairly questioned that, where coasts are indented, or firths or bays are included in the territory of a nation, what are called chambers, by Sir L. Jenkyns, may be established. These are parts of the ocean included within lines drawn from promontory to promontory, or perhaps from points a league distant from each. And it is not a question to be made by any other nation, whether some parts of the space included be or not more than a sea league from the shore. It seems, on the whole, a point for treaty or com-p:iet, or one left to the discretion of sovereign states. But, in fixing extent of maritime territory, they must not invade the rights of others; or pass into, so as to disturb or obstruct, the common path-way of nations, in its freedom of navigation. To this freedom all are entitled on the high seas, which are called the high road, through an expanse given by the creator, to be held in common; indivisible and incapable of allotment, in separate ownershin. or propriety. In a case of similar circumstance, this subject was, at the time, discussed more at large.

The libel charges that on the 7th July, 1791, the libellant purchased one half of this vessel from one Snet-zar, who was then owner of the whole; that said Snetzar, on the 24th of December, 1792, made a fictitious sale of the sloop to Pitcher,\u2019 who afterwards relinquished his purchase; that Snetzar induced two of the seamen belonging to the vessel to make a claim of wages, and to procure a sale of the sloop in Georgia, to William Tyler for \u00a350, which sum was paid to Judson, who was, or pretended to be, a constable acting under legal authority. Libellant prays a sale as above, and also that he may be paid out of the proceeds what may appear due to him on account of the vessel. The answer of Tyler, who now claims the sloop, states that he bought her at public auction of the sheriff of Camden county in Georgia. That he paid a valuable consideration, and did not then know of any claim of said Skrine. Snetzar\u2019s answer was in court, but the proctor' for the actor objected to it; and it was agreed that he should be examined viva voce. He was reluctant in answering particular questions, and prevaricated much. In some points he was directly contradicted by Magwood, the agent employed by Skrine and himself to draw a proper bill of sale. This witness saw Skrine pay the money, and receive formal possession. The sale in Georgia is also proved; by which it appears that Tyler also was a fair purchaser for valuable consideration. There was no evidence to shew that Skrine had forbidden the sale openly; though he had given notice of his claim to the constable who advertised the sloop for sale.\nNo proof was adduced of the proceedings of the court in Georgia, under which the vessel was said to be sold. The defendant\u2019s proctor rested his defence entirely on a defect of title in Skrine, arising from the eleventh section of the act of congress of 1st September, 1789 [1 Stat. 58], for registering and clearing vessels. &c. The intention of this was to relieve America n owners of vessels from the duties on tonnage; but this advantage could not be claimed, unless they complied with certain regulations. Of these the regulation contained in the eleventh clause is one. It declares what transfers or sales shall be void, and that vessels so transferred or sold shall not be entitled to the advantages secured to vessels of the United States. But it is unnecessary to observe further upon this law, as it was repealed (with a few exceptions not relative to this case) by act of congress of 31st December, 1792 [1 Stat. 2S7], and 18th February, 1793 [Id. 305]. The fourteenth clause of the act of December, 1792, which was substituted for the eleventh ck .use of the act of 1789, shews what the framers of that law meant, and completely destroys the ground of defence principally relied on.\nProof of condemnation in a court of competent jurisdiction in Georgia might have vested a legal title in Tyler, who purchased for a valuable consideration, and have set aside the right of the libellant to his moiety. But no such proof has been produced. Great circumspection must be observed in all that relates to the condemnation and sale of vessels; for, otherwise,,owners would hold their property by a very precarious tenure. Hence the master of a ship, though possessed of extensive powers, cannot sell the ship. His contracts with seamen must, if necessary, be fulfilled by hypothecation of the vessel to raise money, if other means fail; and supplies in a foreign port will justify a similar step; but they cannot wholly divest the own-' er of his property.\nIn this case, I am satisfied of Skrine\u2019s right, and therefore decree the sale prayed for in his libel; so far as to effect a division. As to profits, they do not appear to have been great, and there have been expenses which may be set against them. Tyler, the present proprietor, appears to tlie court in a fair point of view. And, indeed, X have doubts of my power in a court of admiralty, to assess damages, or investigate these accounts.

Because it appeared in evidence that the Grand Sachem had a regular register and sea-letter, to shew that she was an American vessel, and to entitle her to all the privileges of one. 2d. That the property in Arnold, an American citizen, was fully proved. 3d. That by the 25th article of the treaty with France, the production of sea-letters was sufficient in itself to prevent any just detention of the vessel. 4th. That the witnesses, who maintained that the trade to New-Orleans could only be carried on in Spanish bottoms, speak of a time prior to the period when Arnold\u2019s vessel was there, and prior also to the edict of 1793, by which that trade was opened. 5 th. That there was much contrariety of evidence as to the legality of trade with New-Orleans, which, though prohibited generally in other than Spanish ships, was sometimes carried on, by express permission, in foreign bottoms. It was proved by one of the witnesses, that two American vessels laden with provisions had arrived at New-Orleans under such permission, notwithstanding which they could not proceed up the river till they had procured Spanish colours. That a compliance with this indispensable requisite was not sufficient to divest the Grand Sachem of her American character and privileges. 6th. That there was no pretence of double papers, or of any fraud or collusion supported by legal proof. That the only Spanish papers were a receipt in that language by the captain, produced to shew that the property on board belonged to Cox and Clark; (but the captain swears he signed it from ignorance of the Spanish language alone, as he knew that the whole belonged to Arnold,) and some Spanish clearances, without which the brig could not have departed from a Spanish port. Clark, too, swears positively that the property was in Arnold, and that he himself was only an agent.\nThe decree of the district court, founded upon these and other reasons, was confirmed in the circuit court, and that decision was finally supported in the supreme court.

That \"the said dollars were shipped by Thomas Plunkett, an American citizen, resident at the Havanna. and consigned to the actor in this cause. That they were put in charge of Don Lewis Cuesta, a passenger on board, who had also a bill of lading and letter of advice respecting this money, which, together with the money, were carried off as above stated. The claim and answer state that this was not a lawful American vessel, and not furnished with the usual and necessary papers. It is denied that the dollars in question belonged to Plunkett, or that said Plunkett was an American citizen; and it is alleged that the vessel was collusively engaged in the Spanish trade, and this money liable to seizure as Spanish property. It is clear from the evidence that this is an American vessel, owned by citizens of the United States, and duly registered in this port. It appeared also that she had no sea letter, there being none at the custom-house when she sailed.\nThe only ground relied on in arguing this cause, was the necessity of a sea letter, according to the 25th article of our treaty with Prance. It was strongly contended that the said article makes the sea letter or passport the only criterion of a free vessel. But this does not appear to me to be the case. If, indeed. an American vessel should be without this passport, and other suspicious circumstances should appear, the French ship of war would be justified in making further search, and. if it should seem proper, in carrying the vessel infra prsesidia of the French courts, for inquiry and adjudication. This has frequently been done; nor will such conduct incur damages if the neutral vessel should be ultimately discharged. In two late cases, The Grand Sachem [Del Col v. Arnold, 3 Dall. 333] and The Polly, the passports so much clamored for, were on board, and were regularly produced; but they availed nothing, for both those vessels were seized and plundered. I cannot say what might have been the case here; but I am clearly of opinion that no article of the treaty could justify the carrying away of this money, without legal adjudication. Some arguments in favour of the claimant were drawn from the law of nations; but they cannot apply where, as in this case, a treaty subsists to guide us. It was said that a proclamation of the president required that all American vessels should be provided with a sea letter. Upon inquiry I find that, by instructions from the treasury department, the different collectors were enjoined to furnish sea letters for the better identification and security of our ships, and as being valuable in several points of view. This is unquestionable, but cannot make law.\nBrown, the boarding officer, was an old American ship master; he examined the papers of this vessel, and must have been satisfied of her neutral character, without which he would have made prize of her and of her cargo, which was Spanish. He would also have seized other sums of money, produced by the captain of the snow as belonging to himself. He might have taken all with equal propriety; but he knew that the vessel was free, and made all on board so. Even contraband was not liable to seizure, unless there had been proof of its being bound to the port of an enemy. The 23d article of the treaty should have taught Mr. Brown its true construction and spirit; he must abide the consequences of disregarding it. It is unfortunate for this claimant to have been connected with persons capable of acting as these privateersmen did. Owners should be careful whom they trust; otherwise, without fault, they will be exposed to frequent misfortune. ' I am pleased to learn that two thirds of the plundered money have been already recovered from the grasp of those who took it. and 1 shall a.t all times afford the aid of this court to pursue the remainder into whatever hands it may have fallen.

The RAMBLER."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "BEE, District Judge\nThe matter to be determined is, whether a plea to the jurisdiction of this court can, consistently with its rules of practice, be filed by a third person, who calls himself an agent of the French republic. All the cases quoted, and some others that I have looked into, maintain that such a plea cannot be exhibited by an attorney, proctor, or solicitor; and the reason is assigned, viz. that as the party must ratify the act of the agent, he thereby admits the jurisdiction of the court in the first instance, and must exhibit his plea to the jurisdiction in propria persona, and on oath.\nIn the present case, a libel has been filed against Edward Ballard, and a sloop and cargo, taken by him on the high seas, belonging to subjects of Great Britain, in amity with us. The libel charges that Ballard is a citizen of the United States; that his vessel was fitted out and is owned there, and that his crew are citizens of the United States: that the capture is therefore illegal, being contrary to the laws of neutrality and of nations. Ballard does' not appear, and answer on oath to tlie charges in the libel, which, by the rules of the civil law, he is required to do; these charges, therefore, must be considered as true. But a third person, Sasportas. comes forward in behalf of the French republic, and of Capt. Ballard, and pleads to the jurisdiction, insisting that neither he nor Ballard is bound to appear, or answer the libel: First, because the vessel commanded by Ballard belongs to the French republic, and was fitted, armed, and commissioned by their authority. Secondly. that Ballard is a French citizen; but that, even if he were a citizen of the United States, he had a right to command this vessel for the benefit of France, and to capture prizes from her enemies.\nCases were produced to shew that any person may, in \u00e1 court of civil law, interpose pleas and claims for others who are absent. This is true to a certain extent; and there would be a failure of justice if it were otherwise. But there is not a single instance of a plea to the jurisdiction interposed in this manner. The reason has been already assigned; the jurisdiction is admitted as soon as the act of the agent is ratified by the principal. At common law, this same consequence follows from filing the power of attorney. The actor in civil law courts, and the complainant in chancery is entitled to call for the oath of defendants, because it is otherwise difficult to get at a knowledge of the facts. To controvert this oath, there must be the evidence of two witnesses.\nIt is admitted that if the suit be in per-sonam, the defendant alone can either plead, answer, or claim But it is said that if the suit be in rem. all persons may interpose a plea or claim, though they are not expressly named in the libel. Nobody, however, can answer, unless named in the libel. Saspor-tas, to justify his interposition in this case, exhibits a certificate from the French consul, authorizing him to comply with certain customhouse requisites as to Ballard\u2019s prizes, of which the Rambler is one. He is further authorized by this paper to hold the proceeds at the disposal of the French republic, whose agent he is said therein to be. The certificate is dated eleven days after this suit was instituted, and when the property was in the hands of the marshal of this court. Letters of agency, or powers of attorney, are to be pursued strictly; and the one in question, authorizing only customhouse entries, can never be a warrant for defending this suit.\nIn the case of Jansen and Talbot, Ballard suffered his third default to be recorded, and relinquished thereby, all claim. Talbot, indeed, stated that he found the 'prize in Ballard\u2019s possession, and took it from him because he had no commission. Here, Ballard does not relinquish, but procures a third person to interpose a plea in his behalf, though he is, himself, on the spot, and has been duly served with process of the court.

It is fortunate on the present, as it must be on every occasion, to find the opinion of the court unanimous: We entertain no diversity of sentiment ; and we have have experienced no difficulty in uniting in the charge, which it is my province to deliver.\nWe are then, Gentlemen, of opinion, that the debts due to Hopton & Powell (who were citizens of South-Carolina) were not confiscated by the statute of South-Carolina; the same being therein expressly excepted: That those debts were not confiscated by the statute of Georgia, for that statute enacts, with respect to Powell & Hopton, precisely the like, and no other, degree and extent of confiscation and forfeiture, with that of South-Carolina. Wherefore it cannot now be necessary to decide, how far one state may of right legislate relative to the personal rights of citizens of another state, not residing within their jurisdiction.\nWe are also of opinion, that the debts due to Brailsford, a British subject, residing in Great Britain, were by the statute of Georgia subjected, not to confiscation, but only to sequestration; and, therefore, that his right to recover them, revived at the peace, both by the law of nations and the treaty of peace.\nThe question of forfeiture in the cafe of joint obligees, being at present immaterial, need not now be decided.\nIt may not be amiss, here, Gentlemen, to remind you of the good old rule, that on questions of fact, it is the province of the jury, on questions of law, it is the province of the court to decide. But it must be observed that by the same law, which recognizes this reasonable distribution of jurisdiction, you have nevertheless a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy. On this, and on every other occasion, however, we have no doubt, you will pay that respect, which is due to the opinion of the court: For, as on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of facts; it is, on the other hand, presumable, that the court are the best judges of law. But still both, objects are lawfully, within your power of decision.\nSome stress has been laid on a consideration of the different situations of the parties to the cause: The State of Georgia, sues three private persons. But what is it to justice, how many, or how few; how high, or how low; how rich, or how poor the contending parties may chance to be ? Justice is indiscriminately due to all, without regard to numbers, wealth, or rank. Because to the State of Georgia, composed of many thousands sands of people, the litigated fum cannot be of great moment, you will not for this reason be justisted, in deciding against her claim; if the money belongs to her, she ought to have it; but on the other hand, no consideration of the circumstances, or of the comparative insignificance of the defendants, can be a ground to deny them the advantage of a favourable verdict, if in justice they are entitled to it.\nGo then, Gentlemen, from the bar, without any impressions of favor or prejudice for the one party or the other; weigh well the merits of the cafe, and do on this, as you ought to do on every occasion, equal and impartial justice.\u201d\nThe jury having been absent some time, returned to the bar, and proposed the following questions to the court.\n1 Did the act of the State of Georgia, completely vest the debts of Brailsford, Powell & Hopton, in the State, at the time of parting the same ?\n2. If so, did the treaty of peace, or any other matter, revive the right of the defendants to the debt in controversy?\nIn answer to these questions, the CHIEF JUSTICE stated, that it was intended in the general charge of the court, to comprise their sentiments upon the points now suggested; but as the jury entertained a doubt, the enquiry was perfectly right. On the 1st question, he said it was the unanimous opinion of the judges, that the act of the State of Georgia did not vest the debts of Brailsford, Powell & Hopton, in the State at the time of passing it. On the 2d question he said, that no sequestration divests the property in the thing sequestered; and, consequently, Brailsford, at the peace, and indeed, throughout the war, was the real owner of the debt. That it is true, the State of Georgia interposed with her legislative authority to prevent Brailford\u2019s recovering the debt while the war continued, but, that the mere restoration of peace, as well as the very terms, of the treaty, revived the right of action to recover the debt, the property of which had never in fact or law been taken from the defendants: and that if it were otherwise, the sequestration would certainly remain a lawful impediment to the recovering of a bona fide debt, due to a British creditor, in direct opposition to the 4th article of the treaty.\nAfter this explanation, the jury, without going again from the bar, returned a Verdict for the defendants.", "author": "JAY,Ghief 7uJ?ice.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "The State of Georgia, versus Brailsford, et al.\nFebruary Term, 1794.\nTHIS cause was now tried, by a Special jury, upon an amicable issue, to ascertain, whether the debt due from Spalding, and the right of action to recover it, belonged to the State of Georgia, or to the original creditors, under all the circumstances, which are set forth in the pleadings and arguments on the equity side of the Court?

On the first point, they contended, that Georgia as a sovereign State, had power to transfer the debt in question from the original creditor, an alien enemy, to herself, notwithstanding some of the debtors were, citizens of another State; that by her confiscation law she had declared the intention to make the transfer ; and that without an inquest of office, her intention had been carried into effect in due form, and according to law, as well in relation to her own citizens, as to the parties who were citizens of South Carolina.\u2014In support of these several propositions the following authorities were cited : 1 H.Bl. 149. Vatt. B. 3. c. 77. Lee on Capt. Bynk. B. 1. c. 7. Vatt. B. 3. c. 18. f. 295. Senk. 121. Sir T. Park. 121. Plow. 243, 324. 1 H. Bl. 413. 2 Bl. Com. 405, 409. 2 Wood. 130. 4 Bl. Com. 386. 1 Hal. P.

Hind. ch. 129. 1 Vern. 58.\n2. On the second point, it was urged, that although the word \u201c sequestration'' was used in the Georgia law, yet, that the law directed the debt to be collected, in the same manner as debts confiscated, and to be put into the treasury, for the use of the state, until it should be otherwise appropriated ; and that the state had never made any other, appropriation ; but, on the first opportunity, claimed it as a forfeiture. The election, therefore, to consider it as a confiscation, was reserved by the state to herself; and her subsequent conduct makes the reservation absolute. The exception of debts in the South-Carolina law cannot govern the cafe as to Powell & Hopton; for that law is only referred to for the manner and form, not for the subjects of confiscation. It only remains, therefore, to enquire, whether, independent of Georgia, the operation and existence of her law can be, and has been, defeated, and annul led. The peace merely does not effect the right of the state; for, the condition of things at the conclusion of the war is legitimate; and all things not mentioned in the treaty, are to remain as at the conclusion of it. The treaty of 1783 does not affect the right of the state; for, though it provides, generally, in the 4th article, that creditors, on either side, shall meet with no lawful impediment, in recovering their debts, this ought to be understood merely as a provision that the war, abstractedly considered, shall make no difference in the remedy, for the recovery of fulfilling debts; that the remedy shall not be perplexed by instalment laws, pine-barren laws, bull laws, paper money laws, &c; but it does not decide, what are subsisting debts, which can only, indeed, be decided on the general principle of the law of nations. Laws of sequestration and confiscation, are not, however, the object of the 4th article of the treaty of peace; but of a subsequent article, in which Congress only promise (all, indeed, that they could do) to recommend to the states, revision and restistution. Debts dicharged by law, where they originated, are every where discharged. Such is not only the doctrine of Georgia, but of the British Statesmen and Judges wherever the question has arisen. The Federal Constitution does not affect the right of the State; for, though it gives effe~ to the treaty of pe~.cc, it furnithesno i~u1e for conftruing the mcaiiing of the pajties to that inftrunient.

BOUTEILLE et al."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "The libel states that Castello was owner and commander of the brigantine St Joseph, which was loaded in the port of Carthagena by himself and other subjects of Spain, which is in amity with the United States. That on the 22d of September last, in his way to Cadiz, he was captured on the high seas by tbe sloop Fair Margaret, commanded by F. H. Hervieux, and carried into Cape Fear river in North Carolina. That two days after their arrival within the bar of Wilmington, tlie said sloop and brigantine suddenly weighed anchor and proceeded to sea. This is said to have been in consequence of directions from the president of the United States to the governor of North Carolina to take possession of the brigantine and deliver her up to the libellant.\nThe libel further states that Hervieux then proceeded to Charleston, whore, upon some agreement between him and the defendant Bouteille, the latter went to sea in the Sans-Pareille. and. at some distance from the bar of Charleston, took possession of tbe brigantine, landed the Spanish crew in Georgia, and brought the vessel into Charleston. Hervieux and his people had previously quitted her.\nThe libel also states some proceedings respecting the brigantine and cargo in consequence of directions from the president of the United States to the governors of North and South Carolina, the latter of whom declined all interference. And the collector of Charleston, not thinking himself authorized to detain the vessel, she was finally left in the hands of Bouteille. thereupon.' by a decree of the consul of France, the said vessel and cargo were advertised and sold, except fifty bales of cotton, which were taken into the custody of the marshal of this court by warrant issued therefrom. The libel concludes by praying restitution of vessel and cargo, and compensation for the detention of the same.\nThe jurisdiction of the court is denied by a plea which states, that the Sans-Pareille was a private vessel of war, duly commissioned by France to capture and make prize of all vessels, goods and merchandize found on the high seas, and belonging to the king of Spain or any of his subjects. That by virtue of this commission Bouteille captured tliis vessel and cargo on the high seas, and without the limits and authority of the United States. That by the 17th article of the treaty with France, tliis court is precluded from investigating the lawfulness of the capture and making any decree thereon. Plea concludes with a prayer that the suit may be dismissed with costs.\nIn support of the plea it was insisted that a neutral tribunal cannot determine the validity of prizes made by two belligerent powers from each other. That the 17th article of the treaty with France is conclusive as to the present question. That the 5th article of the convention -with the United Netherlands compared with the 2d article of the treaty with France, to which it refers, is also conclusive. That this question has already been decided in the district courts of Pennsylvania and New-Xork, against the jurisdiction. in cases not so strong as that before this court. That on the face of the libel it appears that the question of prize or no prize is involved in this case. That this court having no power to condemn, of course cannot restore. Lee. Capt 77, 7S. SI, 220, 221; Bynk. 191. 194; 2 Vatt. Law Nat. 203-205. That this court, not being authorized to decide the question of prize, cannot determine whether the first or second capture was legal. or whether either of the privateers was proscribed. That the president, knowing this, referred the inquiry to the governor, and not to this court, as a matter properly cognizable by the executive, and not by the judiciary. That the opinion of individuals ought not. to operate with the court, the treaty being plain and conclusive. That the jurisdiction of this court is defined by the 9th section of the act for establishing judicial proceedings, and does not extend to eases of captures. The advocates for the libellant contend that this is a case of a peculiar \u00f1a-tee, and must be determined on its own grounds, as it differs from any case in the books. That the St. Joseph having been captured by a proscribed privateer, must be restored, into whatever port of the United States she may go. That if the doctrine contended for on the other side should obtain, a neutral vessel may be cut out of out har-bours or from our wharves, without redress. That the president of the United States having already settled the principle, this court must restore if the present case comes up to that principle. The opinions of the secretary of state, and solicitor-general of Virginia were produced, in which those gentlemen recommended an application to the judiciary. Beaw. Lex Merc. 20G, was quoted to support the jurisdiction of this court. It was said that the question was not whether the treaty should be fulfilled; but whether this case comes within the-treaty. That if this court is deprived of jurisdiction in all cases of prize, it could not give redress for a breach of neutrality in. our own harbours. That the article of the treaty with Holland extended merely to matters of trade and navigation, and did not apply here.\nFrom these pleadings and' arguments, it appears to me that the court must decide three points. 1st. Whether the St. Joseph was the property of Spanish subjects, or not. 2d. Whether the capture was made by the citizens of France on the high sens, beyond our limits of jurisdiction. 3d. AYhether this court has any jurisdiction, if the two preceding points should be determined in the affirmative. As the libel states expressly the Spanish character of this vessel and cargo, it is unnecessary to say a word upon that part of the subject.\nIt is not contended by the libellant that the privateer was owned by other than French citizens, or that there is any defect in her commission. But it is said that the original seizure, was made by a proscribed privateer; and much stress is laid upon the subsequent interference of the president of the United States. The court cannot notice this. The constitution has wisely separated the judicial and executive departments, and we must not infringe the barriers. At any rate the Sans-Fareille was not within the president\u2019s censure; and if the Fair Margaret was improperly fitted out in our ports, and proscribed on that account, complaint must be made to the executive, who will proceed by negotiation to obtain the due redress.\nArguments are drawn from a comparison of the 5th article of the convention with Holland to the 2d of the treaty with France. Neither of them seems to me to apply to this case. The treaty with France is of a general nature, and intended to be permanent under all circumstances of war and peace with other nations. The convention with Holland is distinct from om- treaty with that power, and relates expressly to recap-timed vessels, and to prizes made by either party on their common enemy. As to vessels cut away from a wharf, or captured in our harbours, such acts would amount to felony or piracy and the court would not hesitate to exercise jurisdiction, independently of any treaty in existence. The citizens or subjects of foreign nations receive protection, and owe a corresponding alie-glauco; and what would be criminal in one of our own citizens would be equally so in them, while this state of things lasted.\nThe cases of the ship William, and brigantine Catharine, .decided in the district courts of Philadelphia and New-York, though differing materially from the present, have been adduced to illustrate the point of jurisdiction. I have read both decisions with pleasure; they are ably drawn up, and are, I presume, correct, as no appeal from either has taken place. As to their being the opinions of individuals, I see no reason why that circumstance should deprive them of all right to consideration. Respectable character for legal knowledge, supported by sound argument and clear deduction, will always command respect as well in the case of a judge of the United States as in those of Yattel, Bynkershoek, Puft'endorf, or Boawes. But these opinions are confirmed by the language and conduct of the president of the United States, as contained and evinced in the letter from Secretary Jefferson to Mr. Morris, our minister in Paris. This proceeding of the executive has been submitted to both branches of the legislature, and has met with their decided approbation. This, it is true, wants the forms of law, and is not, therefore, binding upon a judge. If, however, his own opinion concurs, as mine does in the present case, much satisfaction must be derived from the coincidence of sentiment with the men so dignified by their wisdom and patriotism.\nUpon the whole, I am clear that the plea in this case is relevant; that the libel must be dismissed; and that the fifty bales of cotton must be delivered up.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The eases of foreign seamen suing for wages or because of -ill treatment are often in this category: and the consent of their consul or minister is frequently required before the court will proceed to entertain jurisdiction, \u2014 not on the ground that it has not jurisdiction, but that, from motives of convenience or international comity, it will use its discretion whether to exercise jurisdiction or not; and where the voyage is ended, or the seamen have been dismissed or treated with great cruelty, it will entertain jurisdiction even against the protest of the consul. * * * In other cases, also, where the subjects of a particular nation invoke the aid of our tribunals to adjudicate between them and their fellow-subjects as to matters of contract or tort solely affecting themselves, and determinable by their own laws, such tribunals will exercise their discretion whether to take cognizance of such matters or not.\u201d It was also held that, where controversies are communis juris, \u2014 that is. where they arise under the common law of nations, \u2014 special grounds should appear to induce the court to deny its aid to a foreign suitor when it has jurisdiction of the ship or party charged. 114 U.

The HAWKE."], "judges": ["Before BEE, District Judge."], "opinions": [{"text": "This suit, on the part of the United States is founded on the Sth and 32d clauses of the act for enrolling and licensing vessels employed in the coasting trade, passed February 18th, 1793. The 8th clause enacts that if any vessel enrolled and licensed conformably thereto shall proceed on a foreign voyage without first giving up her enrolment and license, and obtaining a register, she shall be liable to seizure and forfeiture. The -32d clause enacts that if any licensed ship or vessel shall be transferred in whole or in part to any person who is not at the time of such transfer, a citizen of and resident within the United States; or if such ship or vessel shall be employed in any other trade than that for which she is licensed, she shall, with her tackle, furniture and cargo found on board, be forfeited.\nTo support the libel, one witness, the deputy-collector, was called, who proved that this schooner on the 14th of May. during the continuation of the embargo, cleared out, by virtue of her license as a coaster, for St. Mary's, in Georgia.\nIt appeared from an exhibit filed by the claimant that the schooner Hawke was sold on the 10th of June at Port-de-Paix, to Bol-chos, the claimant, by Cooke, captain of the schooner, in pursuance of orders from the owner. Gohier.\nThe district attorney contended that this vessel was proved to have departed to a foreign port, without having delivered up her license, as the 8th section of the act directs; that she was. therefore, forfeited. That when in a foreign port, she was sold to a foreigner, for which she is declared by the 32d clause to be forfeited. And that on these grounds sh<> must be condemned in this court.\nIt. was insisted on the part of the United States that upon proof of a violation or tne revenue laws, the court cannot-inquire into tiie motives or causes thereof. That if no fraud is intended, the secretary of the treasury has power to mitigate or remit penalty, upon being satisfied by the judge of the probable innocence of the party. But that the court, in the first instance, is bound to decree according to the letter of the law. That the general rules for construction of penal statutes do not apply here; and that great injury would arise to the United States by practices of this sort. That though by the 9th clause there was some appearance of relief. which might be brought forward as operating against the 32d clause, yet that upon \u00e1 careful investigation it would be found not apply: 1st. Because the sale contemplated in the 9th clause can only mean sale to a citizen of the United States, and not to a foreigner; otherwise the law would be inconsistent. 2d. That sale to a foreigner being prohibited, the words \u201cany district\u2019- must be construed to mean sales at sea, which are expressly mentioned in the act of December, \u25a01792 [1 Stat. 287]. That by the rule of law, -all the clauses of the act must be construed together, to make them consistent, and that the condemnation of this vessel must then follow of course.\nThe 5th and 9th clauses of the act having been relied on as explanatory, and as doing away with the 8th and 32d, we must examine them. The 5th only says that licensed ves-seis shall be no longer privileged when they cease to be wholly owned and commanded by citizens of the United States. The 9th clause provides that the license shall be delivered up within three days after the expiration of the year for whieh it was granted. to the collector of- the district where it was granted, if the vessel be at that time within that district; if not, within three days after her next arrival within that district. If such vessel be sold out of the district, the license must be delivered up within three days after the arrival of the master, within any district, to the collector of such district: under penalty of fifty dollars. This relates only to expired licenses: and neither of these clauses applies to the present case. In the 7th clause of the act for registering vessels we find that if registered vessels are sold or transferred in a foreign port or at sea. the master is obliged, within seven days after his arrival within any district (the same words used in the 2d clause of the licensing act) to deliver up the certificate to the collector of such district. This furnishes a clue to the intention of the legislature. The registering act permits sales of vessels in a. foreign port, or at sea, to foreigners. The licensing act prohibits a sale to foreigners altogether. The licensed owner may indeed dispose of his vessel, upon delivering up his license: but not otherwise. The 9th clause restrains all sales, out of the district, to citizens and residents of the United States; and as the 8th clause makes liable to forfeiture-all licensed vessels proceeding with their license to a foreign port, the place of sale cam never be extended so as to include those ports; but must mean at sea, on the coasts of the United States, or on the fishing banks, where many of these vessels are employed, and, probably, often transferred: in either of which cases the master must report the sale and deliver up the license within three days after the arrival of the vessel in any district. To this view of the licensing and registering acts, and of the different clauses of each, we may with advantage apply the rules for reconciling statutes with themselves, and with others in pari materia.\nTo justify the proceeding in this case, the French consul has certified that he hired this vessel to carry despatches to St. Mary\u2019s, in the state of Georgia. This was lawful: but it will not be supposed that the consul meant thereby to assist an evasion of our laws. The certificate, therefore, can avail nothing. Two letters have been filed as exhibits whieh give reason to conclude that the schooner cleared out for St. Mary\u2019s merely to colour other designs. The answer states that the vessel was to go first to St. Mary\u2019s, and if the Das Casas was not there, was to be further directed by Bolchos, who carried the consul's despatches. It also appears from the answer that she never went to St. Mary\u2019s at all, but proceeded immediately to Port-de-Paix, where, on the 10th of June following, she was sold to Bolchos who went in her as iaissenger, and whose directions the captain was ordered, by his owner, to follow. These circumstances, and the caution of -the captain in returning his coasting license as soon as the vessel was sold, prove clearly that the plan was fixed before she was sold. Both captain and owner knew that the license ought to have been given up before tlie vessel sa iled on any other than a coasting voyage; but then the embargo stood in their way. To evade this they had recourse to the contrivance of which they must now abide the consequence. The libel rests on the 8th and 82d clauses of the licensing act. The answer admits a transgression of both. But the claimant says he was an innocent, bona fide purchaser in market overt; that the forfeiture must relate back to the time of sale; that it could not attach, unless the vessel remained of the same description as when first licensed; that the breach of the law preceded the transfer, and. as no decree of forfeiture had passed previously to the sale, the vessel did not come within the act.\nIf arguments of this sort should receive weight in this court, the laws would be nugatory. \"Such an-exposition of statutes must be made as to prevent their being eluded: and if their meaning is doubtful, the consequences arc to be considered, in the construction of them; but if the meaning be plain, no consequences are to be regarded, for that would be assuming legislative authority.\u201d Bac. Abr. 652. In this case there is sufficient proof that the 8th and 32d clauses of the act of congress for licensing coasters have been infringed. I decree therefore that the schooner Hawlie, with her tackle, furniture, and apparel, be condemned as forfeited to the United States.\nIt appears from the preceding decree that the Hawke was sold on the 10th of June last at Port-de-Paix to Bolchos, by Cooke, who was master of her when she cleared out as a eonster to St. Mary\u2019s. On the same day, 10th June, Cooke informs his owner of this sale, by letter; and incloses him the schooner\u2019s Am\u00e9riean papers, obviously for the purpose of having his custom-house bond can-celled. Two days after, 12th June, Cooke, with a French commission, sailed from Port-de-Paix, in this very schooner, then called La Parisienne, armed, and having Bolchos on board, as owner. On that day they made prize of the Prosperity, a British vessel from Jamaica; and on the 27th following, brought her into this port.\nBefore BEE, District Judge.\nOn plea to the jurisdiction, the judge recapitulated the circumstances of fraudulent contrita nee by which this pretended privateer had evaded the embargo, and escaped from this port by means of her coasting license. He was decidedly of opinion that .the sale of this coasting vessel at Port-de-Paix was illegal, and did not change her neutral character. That upon her return infra prsesidia of this court, she must be considered as American property, never divested out of the original owner. Bolchos could have no just title, but from the court, after condemnation, and compliance on his part with the requisites of the act. He observed that if our coasters could thus, under French commissions, capture neutral vessels, they, would all be converted into privateers, and the laws of this country set at defiance.\nThe plea to the jurisdiction was dismissed.\nBolchos afterwards availed himself of the 66th clause of the act of congress of August 4th, 1790 [1 Stat. 175], and petitioned to have the schooner Hawke delivered uj) to him as owner, on his giving bond with sufficient security to abide the decree of the court. A warrant of appraisement was accordingly is.sued, the other requisites of that act were complied with, and the vessel with everything belonging to her was transferred to the claimant accordingly. She then sailed from this port as French property, with the same equipment, crew, and commission, that she had obtained at Port-de-Paix. On the 12th March. 1795. she cajnured the British brig Favourite, and- brought her into Charleston, where the British consul libelled her. Bol-chos pleaded the 17th article of the treaty with France, in bar to the jurisdiction of this court.\nThe judge sustained the plea, and dismissed the libel with costs.

I have considered it maturely, and am prepared to give my judgment according to my best ability, faithfully, impartially, and agreeably to my view of the constitution and laws of the United States. In doing so, I am much relieved by the consideration that my judgment will not be final; for both parties have claimed that right of appeal wisely provided for them, and to which, no doubt, they will have recourse. The advocates on each side have, in the course of this investigation, entered into a vast field of argument; have contended for their clients, respectively, on a variety of grounds; and have displayed great ingenuity and legal knowledge. To repeat these arguments would be unnecessary; .1 shall only allude to such of them as appear most material.\nThe principal points for the decision of the court, appear to be: 1st Whether this court has any and what jurisdiction relative to matters arising on the high seas. 2dly. Whether the 17th article of the treaty with France restrain such jurisdiction; or whether the act of the 5th of June last controls it. By the third section of the judiciary act of congress [1 Stat. 73] it is declared that there shall be a district court in each district to consist of one judge, who shall hold four, sessions annually, and special courts at his discretion. By the ninth section, the powers of the district courts are expressed, 1st, as to criminal, 2d, as to civil causes. The court shall have exclusive original cognizance in all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; and concurrent jurisdiction with the courts of the several states, or the circuit courts of the United States (as the case may be) where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations, or a treaty of the United States. By the 2d section of the 3d article of the constitution of the United States, it is declared, that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to all eases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States, and treaties made, or to be made. To all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction; in all other cases, appellate jurisdiction under such regulations as congress shall make. The circuit court has no original jurisdiction; but has appellate jurisdiction in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; in which the district court alone has original jurisdiction. Redress must be had there, or nowhere. Suitors, however injured, would look in vain to the laws of this country for redress. They would be stopped in limine, and the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit and of the supreme courts would be virtually annihilated; since there would be no terminus & quo, no fixed point from which they might commence their procedure.\nIn addition to the clauses already recited from the judiciary act, the judges of the supreme court have by their decree in Glass v. The Betsey, 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 6, decided that the several district courts throughout the United States possess all the powers of courts of admiralty, whether considered as instance or prize courts. That case was elaborately argued, and with great ability. The judges of the supreme court held it under advisement for some days, and then decided it so fully as to leave the jurisdiction of this court no longer doubtful. The question was considered as well with respect to the law of nations, as to the 17th article of the treaty with France; and, was fully set at rest on both grounds. But it is said that the act of congress of June, 1794 [1 Stat. 384], by declaring that the district courts shall take cognizance of complaints, by whomsoever instituted, in cases of captures made within the waters of the United States or within a marine league of the coasts or shores thereof, intended to oust them of all other jurisdiction. But the argument has no sort of\u00bb force. Glass\u2019s Case [supra], had j established the jurisdiction of the court in cases of neutral or American property captured on the high seas and brought infra praesidia of our courts. It was there determined that, under such circumstances, the American citizen, or neutral, might institute his suit in the district court, and obtain redress from it. But the act of congress now relied on goes farther, and enacts that, if our jurisdictional limits are violated, restitution shall be made even to a party belligerent who shall complain to the court, and prove his case to come within the provisions of that act. The sixth and seventh articles of the treaty with France as- | sert and recognize the same right. Holland, Prussia, and Sweden have done so by their several treaties with us. No state could maintain its peace or sovereignty, if it were otherwise. I have no hesitation, therefore, in pronouncing that the district court has full jurisdiction upon the present occasion.\nI shall proceed to examine the claim and answer of Talbot upon the other grounds stated therein. This claim is filed on behalf of the owners, officers, and mariners of the private vessel of war L\u2019Ami de la Point-a.-Petre, duly commissioned, armed, and equipped under the French republic; and all the above-mentioned persons are stated to be French citizens. The replication denies this; and we must examine the evidence to determine the fact The exhibit C., by the claimant, proves that the said vessel was, on the 31st day of December last, called the \u201cFair-play,\u201d of Norfolk, in Virginia; was owned by John Sinclair and Solomon Wilson; was equipped by them with eight guns, one hundred weight of gunpowder, some shot, and sundry stores. That she was sold at Point-fi,-Petre by William Talbot, as agent or attorney to. Sinclair and Wilson, to Samuel Red-dick, a native of the United States, who purchased her as having a right to do so, being a naturalized French citizen, made such by the municipality at the above place, three days before. The American register was then can-celled, to be returned to the department that granted it, for the purpose of avoiding any penalty under our revenue laws. The exhibit A. is a certificate from the municipality of Guadaloupe, stating that William Talbot, a native of North America, was, on the 28th day of December, admitted a citizen of France. Exhibit E. is a like certificate that Samuel Reddick, a native of North America, was, on the same day, admitted a citizen of France. Exhibit B. is the commission of the governor-general of Gaudaloupe, authorizing Samuel Reddick, living at PointA-Petre, to fit out for war, under the command of Captain Talbot, the said schooner called D\u2019Ami de la Point-a-Petre. It bears date 2d January 1794. The power of attorney from Sinclair and Wilson to Talbot, authorizing him to sell their vessel, is dated 24th November 1793. From these different exhibits it appears beyond a doubt that this vessel was fitted in the United States, with guns and powder. That she sailed after the 24th November, because the power of attorney is dated on that day. That Captain Talbot, and the new owner, Reddick, were made citizens on the 28th December. That on the 31st the bill of sale was executed, and that, on the 2d of January, she was commissioned as a privateer. It has been insisted on that Talbot\u2019s answer must be' taken as evidence, unless contradicted by more than one witness; because the oath of a party is equal to that of any other single person This is only to be understood of cases where a party is made a defendant; but does not hold so strongly where a voluntary claimant comes forward to swear in support of his claim. In Gilbert\u2019s Law of Evidence (56) there is said to be a great difference between the evidence of an answer and a voluntary affidavit. Talbot could not have been examined as a witness in this case, because he is interested. Shall he then avail himself of the rule of law by being a voluntary claimant?\nLaying aside, however, for the present, any examination as to the ownership of the vessel, which does not seem material, we wiE proceed to the question of expatriation, which has been brought forward in support of Talbot\u2019s right. I have perused with attention the cases cited on both sides as to the right of expatriation and emigration in the general manner there laid down, where no legal prohibition exists, and no prejudice is done thereby. The act of naturalization of congress, and the constitution of this state concur to sanction this doctrine: and we should with an ill grace refuse to our own citizens what we thus hold out to others. The proclamation of the president of the United States tacitly acknowledges the right contended for. It announces that no protection would be granted to such citizens as should by their own acts render themselves liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations; and threatens prosecution against such as should, within the cognizance of our courts, violate the law of nations with respect to any of the powers at war. Much time was taken up in inquiring whether the certificate of Talbot\u2019s citizenship was agreeable or not to the laws of France. If the question turned on that point, I should have no doubt that the certificate from the municipality of Guadaloupe, as it is duly authenticated, ought to be received in evidence. We have no right to inquire whether the governor conformed to their constitution or not. We know that the national convention has suspended many of the articles of the new constitution for the present; and who is to question their power to do so? But, while I admit this evidence so far, I think, it incumbent upon me in this place to notice a variety of certificates, that have been made exhibits in this cause, from the French consul, and his chancery. The 5th article of the consular convention with France fixes the right of the consul as to what acts he may receive in his chancery; and declares that copies of such acts, duly certified under the seal of the consulate shall have such evidence, in the courts of the United States, as their originals would. Of the certificates before me, not one conforms to this regulation; and the consul of France must have been.induced to give them either from ignorance of our modes of practice and rules of evidence, or to get rid of the importunity of the applicants.\nAdmitting, however, the validity of the certificate from the governor of Guadaloupe, the question occurs: had Talbot, a citizen and native of the United States, any right to accept a commission to cruize against the subjects of the United Netherlands, who are under treaty of amity and commerce with us, even if his vessel had been altogether fitted in a foreign port? The 19th article of the treaty with Holland expressly says, that such persons shall be punished as pirates. The 15th article of the same treaty declares that all vessels and merchandize which may be rescued out of the hands of pirates and robbers, on the high seas, without the requisite commissions, shall be restored to the true proprietor. The 16th and 21st articles of our treaty with France are exactly conformable to the preceding article of the treaty with Holland. Now if a native and citizen of the United States, acting under a British or Dutch commission, had captured a French ship and brought her infra praesidia of our courts, we should have been required to restore, and must have restored her. The Dutch owners are equally entitled to our justice.\nIt is contended that the 22d article of the treaty with Holland says, that nothing therein contained- shall derogate from the 9th, 10th, 17th and 22d articles of the treaty with France. If the 16th and 21st articles had been added to the above, this might have been strong ground; but it cannot be maintained that the 17th article (which gives permission to the ships of war or privateers of France to carry their prizes where they please, without being subject to arrest in our ports,) is in any manner derogated from, when, on production of their commissions, which they are bound to shew, it appears that the captain and crew have, from their connexion with the United States, violated another treaty, for the due performance of which we are equally bound; especially when that treaty is in strict conformity with the 16th and 21st articles of our treaty with France, under which we may, hereafter, be called on to furnish redress in cases similar to the present. If a native and citizen of the United States, guilty of treason against them, should, in order to divest' himself of his allegiance, and get rid of the consequences of his crime, expatriate himself, and, within three days after, take a commission to act against us, such a step would not, I conceive, exculpate him, or save him, if taken again, from the punishment he would justly merit That one of our citizens should expatriate himself solely with a view to make war against those with whom we are in treaty of peace and friendship, cannot amount to treason against the United States;' but involves consequences not much less important, and can never be sanctioned by our courts, or our private judgments. The quo animo must enter largely into all considerations upon this delicate question. For my own part, I do not deny, generally, Talbot\u2019s right to expatriate himself, and become a citizen of another country. But I assert that he has no right, In his new character, to injure the country of his first and native allegiance, by open violation of her treaties with friendly powers. ' If he does this, he makes himself amenable to the justice of that country; and, if found within her jurisdiction, will be liable to the penalties established by her laws.\nAs to Ballard, all the facts stated against him in the libel are admitted by his default, and proved by the evidence before the court. The commission from Admiral Vanstable to John Sinclair appears to have been granted for special purposes; first, to prevent the sailing from Norfolk, of some vessels supposed to be fitting out there, with a view to give intelligence of the sailing of the French fleet: but, that having been previously done by the inhabitants of Norfolk, she was next employed as a lookout vessel, to prevent any surprise to the fleet in Hampton Road, or the carrying of intelligence by vessels out of the Chesapeake. The commission is dated on board the Tigre, on the Sd of April. The French fleet was then lying in Hampton Road, but sailed from thence on the 17th, and this vessel accompanied them. On the 20th she arrived in Charleston, not in distress, not armed: the embargo was then in existence. Sinclair, to whom the commission had been granted, having stated to the French consul his inability to go to sea, the consul appointed Ballard in his stead. But, in so doing, he exceeded the powers given him by the consular convention, which relates altogether to acts of a civil nature, and to ships of a civil character. But the substitution in this case is of a military sort, and so the consul himself understood it; for, he states, in his letter to the collector, that the vessel is commissioned by Admiral Van-stable, is destined by him to a secret service of importance, and must be allowed to go to sea, the embargo not relating to vessels so circumstanced. But the embargo comprehended all vessels not militaiy; and the consul\u2019s power is restricted by the convention to those of a civil character. Ballard was, of course, substituted for Sinclair without due authority.\nThe consul\u2019s application to the collector bears date on the 3d of May. The brigantine was taken on the ICth. In the interval, it has been proved that Ballard\u2019s vessel went into the river Savanna, and there took on board guns and ammunition. She has since come into the port of Charleston with her prize. If she ever was charged with secret despatches, or \u2018 sent on a secret expedition, by Admiral Vanstable, she has never executed her commission. There is not a tittle of evidence to show that Ballard ever became a French citizen, or went into a French port. The admiral\u2019s commission to Sinclair was, as appears in evidence, no way improper; it does not authorize a fitting for war, or the capture of prizes. Such commissions, given in our ports, had lately been declared void by proclamation of Fauchet, the French minister. Such as had been previously issued, were by that authority, recalled; and the admiral knew his duty too well to contravene the same, in a few weeks thereafter, and in breach of the laws of neutrality, and of nations. Ballard, therefore, had no authority to capture. The claim put into the libel acknowledges this, and at the same time confirms what his silence had before shewn, viz. that the prize was taken from him, because he could shew no commission. Had the matter rested here, and had Talbot been duly authorized, this capture, unless collusion had been proved, might have been good. But the evidence before the court proves that they cruized in concert. That, on the following day, they captured another vessel, and manned the prize with a party from each vessel. When they were threatened with recapture, Ballard took back his men; and returned them on board the prize as soon as the fear of recapture had vanished. And though Talbot has sworn that he took the prize from Ballard, because the latter had no commission, yet the prizemaster and crews of both vessels remained on board, till her arrival in Charleston. It appears, too, that the capturing vessels were in company, and did not separate till two nights before.\nFrom such a mass of positive and circumstantial evidence 1 feel myself compelled to conclude that Talbot and Ballard cruized together by a concerted plan. That the prize was taken by Ballard, and collu-sively resigned to Talbot, because Ballard had no commission, and had armed and equipped his vessel in a port of the United States. I do not call in question the general right of France to capture the ships and property of her enemies on the high seas, and to refer the question of prize or no prize to her own tribunals. But if France has belligerent rights, the United States have a neutral character to maintain, and neutral duties to discharge. I am influenced by that consideration, by respect for our own sovereignty, and by regard to the law of nations, in decreeing, and I do, accordingly, judge, order and decree that the claim of the above named William Talbot, and his plea to the jurisdiction of this court be dismissed with costs. And I do further order and decree, that the brigantine Vrow Christina Magdalena, with her furniture and apparel, and the cargo on board at the time of her seizure and detention, be delivered over to the actor in this cause on behalf of the original owners of the same.", "author": "BEE, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

That said schooner was formerly called the Robert, is American built, wholly fitted for war in this port, and despatched from hence on a cruise, without having any legal commission: contrary to the laws of the United States, and to the regulations established by the president; and contrary also to the law of nations, &e. Libel denies that any commission issued to a vessel thus equipped could be legal, as against nations at peace with the United States. It sets forth an equipping in this port by taking off quarter deck, cutting port holes, and arming with fourteen carriage guns. It states that she was officered and manned here, and sailed from hence on the 4th March last, on a cruise, and returned on the 26th April following, as a French privateer, without having in the meantime entered any. port or place within the jurisdiction of France. Restitution is prayed of the Friendship and cargo, with damages. The regulations of the executive of the United States respecting the-equipment in our ports of vessels belonging to foreign powers are filed with the libel as an exhibit.\nA plea to the jurisdiction of the court has been put in, and -it alleges that at the time of this capture, the schooner was, and now is, duly commissioned by the French republic; that she was legally fitted out, belongs to French citizens, and authorized to cruise against the enemies of France. That by the law of nations, the treaty with France, and the sixth section of the act of congress of 5th June last [1 Stat. 884], this court is precluded from holding plea of the present matter. With the plea are filed, as exhibits, a copy of the commission to La Montague, registered on the 25th March last, and a condemnation of the schooner Robert as French property, at Nassau in New-Providence, on the 26th July, 1798. This sentence is conclusive against any pretence that this schooner was American property; because by the revenue laws of the United States, she could never become such. But it is contended that this case is like that of Jansen v. Vrow Christina Magdalena [Case No. 7,-216], and must be decided upon the same principles. But the law there laid down, and supported by 1 Vatt. Law Nat. 144, 5, and 2 Vatt. Law Nat. 7. 8. is that if a neutral nation grants the privilege of equipment in her ports to one belligerent, she must grant it to another; by treaty with France, no citizen of the United Netherlands could have been allowed to arm against her; of course, the rule of neutrality required that France should not arm in our ports against the Dutch. The only feature in this case resembling that of Jansen v. Vrow Christina Magdalena [supra], is that both privateers were originally fitted out here. There the equipment was made by American citizens; here the property is French, and the commission expresses an arming for her own commercial protection, as well as for the purpose of cruising against enemies of France. This brings her within the very regulations relied upon by the lebellants, the fifth clause of which allows that any vessels of France of a doubtful character, as being calculated for commerce or war, may be equipped in our ports. The sixth clause excludes from this privilege all powers at war with France, and seems thereby tacitly to admit that such French vessels might arm here. The officers of the customs appear to have thus distinguished, for they have given no notice of the equipment of the Montagne to the governor, or district attorney, which the instructions say they shall do, in case of any contravention thereof. If this be so. shall the subsequent commission lessen a right to capture? I think not. If, indeed, the capture had been made before the commission was received, a question might have arisen between the captors and their sovereign, .the latter of whom might, perhaps, have claimed. Much stress has been laid upon the date of this commission. It issued from the marine office in France on the 5th December last, was examined and certified by the governor of Guadaloupe on the 10th of March (six days after the schooner sailed from hence), and registered at Point-a-Petre on the 25th of March. This was twenty-one days after the sailing from Charleston, and gives sufficient time for receiving the commission at Point-ft-Petre, previously to the capture of the Ship Friendship, on the 26th of June following. In Jansen v. Vrow Christina Magdalena [supra], our treaty with Holland was infringed; and though, by the law of nations, the bringing infra,, prsesidia of a neutral nation might justify restitution in any case, yet our treaty with France (17th article) has expressly altered that law in cases like the present, where the commission was granted in a French port to French citizens.\nUpon full consideration of the pleadings, arguments, and evidence of this case, I am of opinion that the libel must be dismissed.", "author": "BEE, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

That on the 23d May she was captured on the high seas by the armed schooner Minerva, commanded by Hervieux, who put a prize-master and crew on board, and ordered her for Charleston. That two days after the Sans-pareille privateer joined them at sea, and also sent some men on board. That on the arrival of the prize at Charleston, she was entered at the customhouse as prize to the Sans-pareille: and that the cargo has been sold to several persons. It appeared in evidence that the Minerva was a French bottom, built at St. Domingo, and fitted out in the year 1792, to act against the brigands in that island. That on the breaking out of war she was the first vessel equipped and commissioned to cruize against the enemies of the French republic, and that she made ' \u2022 some prizes. That when the British took Jeremie in 1793, this schooner was in the har-bour, and was carried off by seven Frenchmen who passed the forts, notwithstanding they were fired upon. That she was soon after taken and carried- to Jamaica, from whence she sailed again as an English privateer to cruize against the French. That she was then captured by the Atalanta, a French privateer, and sent to this port as prize. That she remained here from the month of January, till May, when she sailed from this port, and was reported at the customhouse as prize, both at coming in, and going out. It appeared that she had eight guns and eight swivels mounted, and two guns and two swivels in the hold; and that she was pierced for twelve guns. That she had also on board several boxes of arms at the time she was taken by the Atalanta, and that she'had been furnished with new sails at Jamaica. The collector proved that she was reported and entered at the customhouse as having ten guns. That she went out with that number, and was not armed or equipped here. No proof was offered of her having any other commission than that under which she sailed before she was taken by the British. Two witnesses proved that she had received repairs in this port Her- quarterdeck was cut down, and maindeck laid flush, and four new swivel stocks were put up. She had a new foremast, sweeps, and new spars fore and aft, and some new sails. She was also furnished with ringbolts, bolts, iron stanchions, and an iron tiller. Five exhibits were filed, but are inadmissible, except the copy of the Sans-pareille\u2019s commission. Indeed, after the rejection of many of the same nature, not coming within either the letter or the spirit of the consular convention with France, I was rather surprised to find these introduced. In future, that the proceedings may not be too voluminous, I shall consider such exhibits on their first production, and admit or repel them then.\nIt was contended for the actor that all fitments for war in the ports of a neutral nation are illegal. That the law of nations protects Spain in this respect, though we have no treaty with her. That capture by a vessel having no commission, is unlawful: and prizes so taken, if brought into a neutral port, must be restored. That no change of property can take place before condemnation by some authorized tribunal; and that as the Minerva was made an English vessel by capture and condemnation, her original French character could only be restored in the same way. That by the marine law of France, certain regulations must be complied with before a commission to cruize will be granted; and that these regulations were not observed in this instance. That as Hervieux had no commission, he could have no right, and could transfer none to the captain of the Sans-pareille. Thai as no jus post-lim-inii could apply to the vessel, after eondemnation, neither could it renew the efficacy of the commission. That, even if the original commission could have survived, it must inure to the original possessor, and not to Her-vieux. Moll, de J. Mar. pp. 9, 41,- was quoted to shew a distinction between prizes made by public ships of war, and such as are made by privateers, and letters of marque; which last, if brought into a neutral port, before condemnation, must be given up. And it was added that, by more modern authorities, even public ships of war were subject to the same law. That though the 17th article of the treaty between the United States and Prance [8 Stat. 186] allows a temporary asylum, yet as no condemnation has taken place, and the property been sold here, the original owners may recover it.\nThe claimants, in support of their plea to the jurisdiction, rely on the 17th article abovementioned, as' conclusive. They admit that by the general law of nations, property captured and brought into neutral ports may be delivered to the original owner; but they contend that the treaty alone must decide this case. That this treaty is the supreme law of the land, and takes away all jurisdiction from this court.\nIt was also conceded that the court could grant redress in the following circumstances: (1) Where American citizens capture the property of a nation, as the Dutch, with whom we have a treaty to the contrary. Such was the case' of Talbot v. Janson [3 DalL (3 U. S.) 133]. (2) Where French citizens capture American property, and bring the same infra pnesidia of the .courts of the United States. (3) Where the capture is made within neutral limits. (4) Where the capturing vessel has been equipped in our ports, contrary to the rights and duties of neutrality.\nIt is contended, however, that the present case does not come within either of these classes. That the citizens of France may rightfully capture the vessels of her enemies, with or without a commission, so far as concerns neutrals. That, in this case, the property having been sold, and passed into the hands of a third person, the spes recuperandi is gone. That the repairs made to the Minerva in our port were lawful, and that all the powers at war were privileged to the same extent. That the act of congress of 5th June, 1794, had settled the limits of jurisdiction in this court, and that they did not comprehend the present case. From this view of the evidence and arguments it is clear that the interference of this court can only be justified by such equipment of the privateer in this port as contravened the laws of neutrality.\nAll the cases, from Molloy, Yattel, Bynker-shoek and others, relative to delivery up of prizes brought into neutral ports before condemnation, are superseded by our treaty with France. This has altered the general law of nations quoad the parties thereto, and all independent nations have a right to do this. Authorities to support the position are too common to need enumeration. Great stress was laid on the marine law of France, as containing indispensable regulations without due attention to which no lawful prize could bo made. This might have weight before French tribunals on a question of right between the uncommissioned captor and his sovereign; and the lex loci might well apply. All the civil law writers admit that the prize might be made for the benefit of the sovereign; and it has been doubted whether the nation suffering by such unauthorized cap.ture might punish the captor for piracy, if he \u25a0 should fall into \u25a0 their hands. But it never was supposed that a neutral nation could do this.\nIt must also be conceded that a distinction was formerly taken between national and private ships of war, as to the restitution of prizes brought into a neutral port. But this difference is no longer made; and the whole matter seems finally settled by modern decisions, particularly by the case in 4 Burn. & E, [4 Term R.] 386, 387 [Lord Camden v. Home], which must enforce conviction where-ever it is read. In the case of Talbot v. Janson, 3 Dall. [3 U. S.] 133, the prize was restored because our treaty with Holland had been violated. No such thing is pretended now. This vessel has been proved to have been originally French, and this court will not inquire into the circumstances of her capture by the British, and subsequent recapture by a vessel of her own nation. She came into our ports armed and equipped for war; and the alterations and repairs made during her stay here did not amount to an infringement of our neutral rights. The fixing of four new stocks for swivels, and procuring two carriages for the guns in her hold might have brought her within the act of the 5th June; but she.had sailed previously to the passing of that act. The president\u2019s instructions permitted such alterations and additions, even if doubtful in their nature, as regarded defence or war; and all the belligerents were entitled to the same privilege.\nUpon the whole, I consider the 17th article of our treaty with France as conclusive against the jurisdiction of this court, and I dismiss the libel with costs.", "author": "BEE, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The ship was bound on a voyage to Liverpool and back; the actors shipped at different times in the month of June last, and signed articles with Captain Wilson to proceed on the voyage. On the 4th July the ship attempted to pass the bar, but struck, and made so much water, in consequence, as to be forced back to Charleston. This took place on the 29th July; and on the 2d August, Captain Wilson left the ship. On the 5th Captain Hazard took command of her, on which all the men quitted her, and went on shore: some of the crew, however, returned and went to work under the new captain. The others, among whom were several of these actors, were taken up and sent to jail under the 7th section of the act of congress for the regulation of seamen. [1 Stat 134.] They applied to this court for a discharge, suggesting that the ship was unfit for sea, and requested a survey. This was ordered, and they were directed to return on \u25a0 board and do their duly. On the day following, they went on board and carried the vessel up to Gadsden\u2019s wharf. From the logbook it appears that they remained on board, more or less, until the 24th of August, when they all left the ship, and have not since returned. It appears also by the logbook that the seamen were dissatisfied at several times, and though no reason is assigned, yet it appears from a letter of the owners that upon their insisting that the vessel should go to sea, the men refused to proceed in her.\nThree circumstances have been stated as material in all contracts with seamen. 1st. That the vessel be sound. 2d. That the captain be known to them, and one on whom they may depend for their wages. 3d. That the voyage be certain and defined.\nIt is contended that, in this case, the two first requisites fail; that the seamen are no longer bound by their articles; and that their wages are due. That they are not within the act of congress. That a change of captain is a breach of the articles, and that an equitable construction should be given to the contracts of seamen. Hopkinson, 122 [Brice v. The Nancy, Case No. 1,855].\nIt is clear that this vessel is not seaworthy. A survey lias been made, and it appears that \u2019 the ship must be unloaded. When these men went on board the second time, the voyage appeared to be at an end. The original captain and the mate had quitted; all the passengers had removed their baggage, and come on shore. This is a state of things not contemplated at the signing of these articles, and. must be taken into consideration by every court acting upon equitable principles. As to the change of captain, I do not think it justifies the seamen in leaving a ship after they have signed articles to proceed on a definite voyage; for, although the contract is made with the captain, yet it is chiefly on the credit of the vessel that they depend for their wages. And if the vessel be lost, it cannot be said that they would \u25a0 have a claim on the captain personally. The. captain may die, or be dismissed by the owners, after articles signed; but this would by no means discharge the seamen. The vessel, the owners, and the new captain would be liable to their claim for wages, and, as contracts are mutual, they are also bound. As to the certainty of voyage the articles are sufficiently express.\nThe circumstances of this case are of a \u2022peculiar kind, and the regulations of the act of congress have not been duly attended to. If, on the first refusal of the men to do their duty, (because the captain was changed) the directions of the act had been followed, I do not think I could have interfered; but it is a penal law and must be construed strictly. The act requires the name of each seaman absenting himself to be entered in the logbook; this was not done: a general entry \u201cthat the mate and all hands had gone ashore\u201d is all that appears. At this period, the owners had an option of sending these men to jail, under the 7th section of the act; or of resisting payment of their wages, under the 5th. They chose the former, and cannot have both remedies. Gammon, the mate; and Cole, the steward, are not on the logbook at all. They, therefore, cannot be affected in any way by the act. The other parties to the suit, after they were taken from jail, continued in the ship till she returned to Gadsden\u2019s wharf. The logbook specifies their working on board from the 13th to the 23d of August On the 24th the logbook states that \u201cthe people were all absent,\u201d whereas they should have been severally named. It is laid down in 3 Bac. Abr. 594, \u201cthat if a contract be made with seamen to go a voyage, and they, in order thereto, work in a harbour, and afterwards the voyage be interrupted through the owner\u2019s fault, (as if the ship be arrested for debt, &c.) the seamen shall have their wages for work done in the harbour.\u201d This seems applicable to the case before me, for though the owners are not in fault, the hardship upon the seamen would be equal, if they should lose what they have earned.\nUpon the whole, I cannot decree a forfeiture of wage's, because the act of congress has not been complied with; yet as there has been much to blame in the conduct of the men, and as the owners have been compelled to hire others in their room, I shall not saddle the latter with double expenses. I therefore adjudge and decree: That Gammon, the mate, having quitted the vessel on the change of captain, and thereby sanctioned, in some measure, that conduct in the rest, shall be satisfied with one month\u2019s wages in advance, which he received on signing the articles. That Cole, the steward, who has received ten dollars in advance, receive ten more, as all to which he is entitled. That the seamen who have been imprisoned receive their wages, as stipulated in the articles, from the time they respectively signed them, until the 24th August, when they finally left the ship; deducting, however, any sums that may have been advanced to them, and also their pay from the 5th August to the 13th, during which time they were not on board.

The evidence is, in all material points, the same that was produced in the cause of Jansen v. The Magdalena [Case No. 7,216], and these defendants; except only as to the matter of damages. I shall not, therefore, recapitulate that evidence; the former case having been so recently decided.\nThe proceedings are, now, in personam; but the principles of both cases, as relates to the law of nations and to treaties, are the same. The plea to the jurisdiction of the court is made as by [William] Talbot, with this difference, that, upon the former occasion, [Edward] Ballard made default, and every charge was of course taken, as against him, pro con-fesso. Here he has pleaded, and his advocate relies upon the ground not taken in the first case. I shall consider the arguments by which it is contended that a difference exists as to the merits. The former decree was founded on the 19th article of the treaty with the United Netherlands. It is said that Ballard\u2019s commission does not come within that article.\nIt is also contended that the schooner L\u2019Ami de la Libert\u00e9 is a vessel belonging to the French republic, and therefore not within the letter or spirit of the 19th article of the treaty with Holland. That any American citizen may lawfully command a public vessel, under French authority, and may of right examine, on the high seas, vessels belonging to neutrals or to the enemies of France. Molloy, 1, 3, 12. That Captain [Peter] Martins, having made resistance to such examination, must abide by the consequences of his own imprudence.\nI have already declared my opinion of the authority under which Ballard acted. It runs thus:\n\u201cIn the Name of the French People. On board the Tigre, 13th of Germinal, 2d year of the republic, &c. Peter John Vanstable, rear admiral commanding a'division of the naval forces of the republic, stationed on the coast of the United States of America. In consequence of the offer of citizen Sinclair to enter, voluntarily and from pure love of liberty, into the service of the French republic, and the engagement on his part to conduct himself altogether as a good French republican, I give him an order to take command of the schooner \u2018L\u2019Ami de la Libert\u00e9,\u2019 and to fulfil the commission confided to him by me. {Signed) Bear Admiral Vanstable.\n\u201cWe Anthony Louis Fonsportuis, consul of the French republic, charged with the consul\u2019s office at Charleston, certify to all whom it may concern that the citizen John Sinclair, having declared to us his inability to go to sea, requires us to transfer the present commission to the citizen Edward Ballard. We have therefore transferred the said commission to the said Ballard, to be executed by him' in the place of said Sinclair.\u201d\nGiven at the consul\u2019s office.\nThis commission, however legal for the purpose mentioned in it, was illegal when applied to others, so different from its tenor; and Ballard was highly criminal in so converting and abusing it. What proof is offered that this vessel belonged to the French republic? The admiral\u2019s commission does not describe her as such; nor is she so called in the consul\u2019s letter to the collector of Charleston. He says, only, that she is under a special commission of Admiral Vanstable, charged by him with a secret expedition. That it is indispensable that she should be allowed to go to sea; and that she does not come within the embargo. But he does not say she belongs to the republic. If we examine the evidence of Mr. Airs, we shall find that at the time when she was employed by Admiral Vanstable in the business committed by him to Sinclair (which both Airs and Sasportas explained to be unrigging and prevention from sailing of certain vessels at Norfolk) he (Airs) sailed in her from the fleet to that place. She was then, he says, commanded by Ballard, and Sinclair appeared as a passenger on board. He says further: that she was raised from a pilotboat, and was fitted with railing and stanchions, and a streak above wale, for guns. When she arrived here, she came in under American colours: Wallace the boarding' officer, minuted her as a Virginia pilotboat, armed in Norfolk. The collector says she was entered as such, by Sinclair; that he alone managed all that related to her at the customhouse, even after she had been transferred by the consul to Ballard. Add to this Craig\u2019s evidence, and no doubt can remain as to her being private, not public property. Here is, indeed, proof positive from the acknowledgment of Sinclair himself, and of Talbot, that she was owned in part by Sinclair, whose partnership with the French republic is too ridiculous to be credited. All reliance upon the ground of her being a public vessel of that government must fail. As therefore Talbot, under the treaty with Holland, was not at liberty to capture Dutch property; as Ballard\u2019s was a private vessel, and himself incapable of making lawful capture, for want of a lawful commission; I can do no otherwise in this case than I did in that of Jansen v. The Magdalena [supra], I must sustain the jurisdiction of this court, and declare the proceedings of both these defendants to be wholly illegal.\nIt remains to inquire whether the court has any, and what, further jurisdiction in cases of this nature. The 9th section of the judiciary law of congress vests this court with exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. This necessarily includes all matters arising on the high seas, of a civil nature; all contracts, .torts and trespasses; and, by the law of nations, is extended to all civil contests between our own citizens, and between foreigners, as to the right of property which has been illegally and piratically taken on the high seas. Such property, may if retained, and brought within the jurisdiction of the court, be restored: and equivalent damages may be given, if it has been disposed of. The court may proceed civiliter, even where it is, expressly, without criminal jurisdiction. In Le Caux v. Eden Doug. 594, it is shewn, by two cases, that the court of admiralty in England, sitting as an, instance court, restored property taken by pirates, who had not been apprehended.\nThe supreme court of the United States having, in Glass v. The Betsey [3 Wall. (3 U. S.) 6], decided that this court is possessed of all the powers of a court of admiralty, whether as an instance or prize court, it must be authorized to inquire into, and to determine the quantum of damages and costs in all cases of trespass or tort. The cas\u00e9 from- Douglas above reported is supported by that of Livingston v. M\u2019Kenzie, in 3 Durn. & E. [3 Term R.] 333. And similar proceedings have been had formerly in this court, as appears by reference to its records. I will, at present, content myself with mentioning the case of Walton v. Jeamans, in August, 1748 [unreported]. There the defendant was condemned to pay \u00a3500 for unlawfully capturing and entering the libellant\u2019s vessel and taking therefrom the goods, wares, and merchandise enumerated in the libel. Hopk. 137, is full to the same point, viz. the power this court has to assess damages in personam. I shall proceed to do so in the case before me.\nIt is pretended by the defendants that they boarded the actor\u2019s vessel (Fortune der Zee) merely for the purpose of examining her. Why then did they, in the first instance, order her to strike? and why, after boarding her, and finding that she was Dutch property, did they not relinquish the prize? Their conduct, on the preceding day, in the case of the Magdalena makes their real intentions too plain. But the bringing off the captain and crew of the Fortune, when they found themselves obliged to give up the ship, serves to shew that the folly of their conduct was equal to the guilt of it: for had they been left, the vessel would have proceeded on her voyage, and the trouble and expense of this suit would have been spared. It has been proved that the sails and rigging were much injured; and though this has been attributed to the circumstance of the vessel\u2019s going into the Havanna, it is neither probable that it was so, nor was any evidence adduced to support the assertion.\nI find by reference to merchants of respectability, well acquainted with such business, that the amount of damages done to the sails and rigging could not be less than... Dollars 500\nThe pay and wages of a captain and seamen to navigate her to Holland is, at least. 300\n(I make no allowance for demurrage at the Havanna, as it appears that the vessel waited there for the fleet, not choosing to sail alone.)\nFrom statements in the libel, which are not contradicted, and from information of the witnesses, I calculate captain Martin\u2019s damage, by loss of clothes, plate, &c. at.. Dollars 750\nHis pay as captain, from 18th May to 18th December, (seven months) when he may probably get back to Holland, amounts, at thirty dollars per month, to. 210\nHis expenses here for four months, at thirty dollars per month. 120\nCounsel\u2019s fees . 15\u00d3\nTotal amount.Dollars 2,030\nOf this sum I decree to the owners of the ship.Dollars 800\nTo the captain, as above.Dollars 1,230\nAs both defendants were included, by consent of their counsel, in this decision, I adjudge and order that each of them pay one moiety, say ten hundred and fifteen dollars, of the above total amount; and that they pay the costs of suit. I direct further that twelve hundred and thirty dollars be paid to the captain of the Fortune der Zee; and the remaining eight hundred deposited in the branch bank here, till applied for by the owner or owners of the ship, or their authorized agent.", "author": "BEE, District Judge.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The PEGGY."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "It appears from the articles and evidence produced in this case, that the actor [William Herron], on the 9th October, 1793, shipped in this port, as cook of this schooner, at ten dollars per month. That he performed the voyage out and home, and discharged his duty well. That, on the day after the vessel returned here, he went ashore; and though he came back within the twenty-four hours of each day, yet he never did any work on board afterwards. On the 2d October he quitted the vessel finally, and went to sea on another voyage, leaving a letter of attorney to receive his wages. It appears that after he first left the schooner, the captain hired another cook in his room, who continued on board at a dollar per day, notwithstanding this man\u2019s regular appearance on board daily. It is contended on the part of the owners that this leaving of the vessel without permission amounts to a forfeiture of all this man\u2019s wages; and the 5th clause of the act of congress [of 1790 (1 Stat. 133)] \u201cfor the government and regulation of merchant seamen\u201d has been relied upon to this effect The articles also were produced to this point. I am to decide whether a total or partial forfeiture of wages has been incurred. It is part of the law of all the maritime powers that if a seaman be absent from his ship forty-eight hours, without leave, he forfeits his wages. Congress has adopted this regulation; and the only new matter contained in our law upon this point is relative to the sort of evidence by which such misbehaviour shall be proved. In order to fix the forfeiture, it was formerly necessary to make a protest before some notary or other officer, and that upon oath. The act of congress declares, that in such cases the officer having charge of the log-book, shall make an entry therein of the name of the offending seaman; and, if he return within forty-eight hours, he shall only forfeit three days\u2019 wages, for each day of absence. i But if he absent himself for more than forty-eight hours, he shall forfeit the whole. The mate, or officer having the logbook, is, by this act, vested with very extensive powers. He is not sworn to the faithful discharge of this duty, and, if a bad man, may materially |injure every incautious mariner; and such'is their general character. The act is highly penal in other respects, particularly as it authorizes commitment to jail for leaving the vessel without permission. I think, therefore, it should be construed strictly: it is favourable, indeed, to owners and shipping, but highly rigid as respects the seamen.\nI will now recur to the evidence in this cause. We find by the log-book that this schooner arrived at our wharves on Sunday the 21st September at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. An entry is made that the cook went ashore that day without leave of any person on board. No other charge appears against him, nor any thing else respecting him; no mention is made of his ever returning on board. Yet the mate in his examination declared that lie came on board the next day, and staid an hour and a half; that he was there in liquor; that he continued to come on board daily, and staid always about the same space of time. Not only is the log-book silent as to this, but we find almost daily mention that \u201call hands were on board lading salt.\u201d Nothing conclusive therefore, appears in the log-book. If at the end of forty-eight hours from the time he first absented himself it had been entered that he had not returned, a forfeiture must have followed. As it is, we should rather infer that he was included in the expression \u201cAll hands on board.\u201d We must, therefore, have recourse to other evidence.\nThe mate proves that another cook was hired in the actor\u2019s place, but does not know by whom. The captain is gone to sea, and we lose the benefit of his testimony.\nMr. Wyatt\u2019s evidence must be conclusive as far as it goes. He says that a few days after the vessel arrived, he was on board, and the captain asked him if he had seen the cook. He answered, that the cook was on shore with a sore leg. The captain desired him to advise the cook to return on board, and save the money he had earned, as he was then paying a dollar a day to a substitute. He added some further advice as to this man and a large family who would suffer by his neglect of duty, as well as waste of money on shore. From this it would seem that neither the captain nor the actor entertained a thought of a total forfeiture at this time. The 7th section of the act allows the master to have his seamen sent to jail for an offence of this sort; but he preferred hiring one in his room, out of regard both to him and his family. Wyatt says the man acquiesced in the captain\u2019s hiring a person in his room; here, then, is a tacit agreement between them, under the impression of which the man seems to have gone to sea, leaving a power to receive his wages, subject to this deduction. Neither vessel, owner, nor captain was injured by the arrangement, and I see no equitable cause why he should forfeit what he had so well earned for twelve months preceding. As to the remedy under the act, it was waived by the defective entry in the log-book. Nevertheless, I think the conduct of this man blamable, and that he ought to be mulcted agreeably to one pa# of the clause above cited. He was absent from the vessel fifteen days previous to the 7th October, when the vessel was discharged; he must therefore lose forty-five days wages, that is, a month and a half at ten dollars... 15\nHire of a substitute for fifteen days, at one dollar per day. 15\nDollars 30\nLet that sum, then, be deducted from what is due to him; and as the act declares that where one person is hired in the room of another, damages shall be recovered with costs, I decree further that the actor pay the costs of this suit.", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

The CANDALERO."], "judges": [], "opinions": [{"text": "The claimant in this case has produced no evidence, nor attempted to controvert that of the actor. The latter has proved that he is a native and citizen of the United States, and sole owner of an American schooner called the Polly. That on the 5th day of July last this vessel cleared regularly from this port, with a cargo, bound to the island of Providence, having on board all necessary papers. That the cargo was wholly neutral, and so expressed in the clearance, which enumerated every article; and that there was nothing contraband on board. That the Polly, commanded by Noah Wright, and having the actor on board, passed. the bar of Charleston on her intended voyage, in company with a private armed vessel of war called the Narbonnoise, fitted under the authority of the French republic, and commanded by the claimant. That they proceeded together at sea about nine leagues, and then, on the afternoon of the same day, the said privateer took possession of the Polly, took out the owner, captain and crew, except one man. and carried the vessel to Port-de-Paix in St. Domingo, as prize. That the clearance and other necessary documents wea-e produced, but entirely disregarded. Upon their arrival at Port-de-Paix, an examination took place in the office of admiralty, and a decree was passed ordering immediate restitution of the vessel and such parts of the cargo as belonged to M\u2019Grath, and a sale of the rest, (which also belonged to American citizens) with a deposit of the money, until the owners should prove their right to the same.\nIt appears that before redelivery of the schooner to her owner she had been run ashore in a gale of wind, and received so much damage that she was sold for 600 dollars; much less than her previous value. And, there being no market for the owners\u2019 part of the cargo, he left it in the hands of the captors, and brings this suit for compensation for the loss he has sustained; 1st. By being carried to a distant port instead of that to which he was bound, and where his cargo would have sold to great advantage. 2d. By the damage done to his vessel, which he was compelled to sell at a very low rate, for want of funds to repair her. 3d. By spoliation of all his cabin and other stores. 4th. By being taken out of his own vessel, and confined for sixteen days on board the privateer. 5th. By the derangement of his affairs, having been kept out of business since August last.\nThe claim for damages is founded on the law of nations, and on the 22d, 23d, 24th. 25th, and 27th articles of the treaty with France.\nThe only justification set up by the claimant is 1st. His right, by virtue of his commission to board and search all vessels at sea. 2d. That an adjudication having taken place in the court of the power to whom the captor belonged, this court cannot inquire into the grounds of such decree, but must give full faith and credit to the same; and that if the party has been injured he must apply for relief to the executive power of these states.\nThe 27th article of the treaty with France regulates the mode of proceeding of their vessels of war and privateers, which, in the' present instance was wholly disregarded. Hervieux first enticed this schooner to follow him to sea by an offer to pilot her over the bar, as she had no pilot on board. As soon as she had proceeded above a marine league from the coast she was pursued by the privateer, and two shots fired at her; the lieutenant then boarded her with five others, all armed, carried the captain and papers on board the privateer, and sent a prizemaster and crew on board the prize. Hervieux, on examining the papers, acknowledged their validity, but said that he would carry the vessel into a French port where provisions were wanted, rather than suffer her to proceed to an English one. This was done without the slightest pretext, and in wanton violation of the treaty: for even if she had had contraband goods on board, more than the captor could have received on board his vessel, the 13th article of that treaty provides that, this being the nearest port, the Folly should have been brought in here, -where a proper and speedy remedy would have been afforded.\nAs to the right of this court to inquire into the adjudication that took place at Port-de-Paix, I am ready to declare that I should not do so with aiiy view to controvert such adjudication; for the sentence of an' admiralty court duly constituted must receive full credit in foreign countries. But I am called upon to support that decree. The case from Ld. Raym. 935, is good law, and it is there said by Lord Holt that the sentence of a civil law court in a foreign realm should be executed in England by a court of the same nature, and proceeding according to the same law. Had a suit for damages been dismissed at Port-de-Paix, it might have been a question whether this suit should be sustained. But as the illegality of the seizure was pronounced there, as the action is transitory, and the actor has chosen to seek for compensation in this court, I must say that his suit is properly brought. I think the libel relevant, and fully proved, and shall, therefore, proceed to inquire into the quantum of damages. The principles laid down in Lecaux and Eden (Doug. 575) apply here. Guided by them, and having fully inquired into the loss of time and property, and considered the imprisonment on board the privateer, I adjudge and decree that the claimant pay to the actor 1984 dollars, with costs of suit, and that the privateer remain under attachment till the same be paid.\nLoss on vessel. 200\nLoss of stores . 274\nOorn, worth at Providence. 510\nDetention of captain and crew and consequent loss. 1000\nDollars 1984", "author": null, "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

Whether this court has jurisdiction to proceed, by attachment, for torts. 2d. Whether, even if they have not. exceptions to the jurisdiction are not now too late.\nBy the 9th section of tiie judiciary act this court has exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty, and maritime jurisdiction. At common law, an action will lie for seizing, stopping or taking a ship upon the high sea. Le Caux and Eden. Our stale courts might, therefore, have exercised such jurisdiction; hut tiie act of congress vests it exclusively in this court, in the first instance. If, then, the present motion succeeds, there would be a right without a remedy. It is not denied that attachment will lie in matters of debt or contract. Why not in cases of tort? If an alien sue here for a tort under the law of nations or a treaty of the United States, against a citizen of tiie United States, the suit will be sustained. Shall it be otherwise, where the alien is the offender, and one of our citizens the party complaining? The object of the attachment is to secure redress out of the property of the party, when you cannot get at his person. If he comes in time, and gives security, his property may be discharged. In short, I can see no reason for granting what is sought by this motion, and many for refusing it. Even if it were a new question, I should think it one of the cases in which a good judge would choose \u201campliare jurisdietionem.\u201d\nThe second point is. whether after decree, and writ of error lodged, this application is not too late. I think it is. The parties themselves proposed to lodge this money as security, subject to tiie order of tiie court. At any rate it would have been liable, after the decree had passed.

Those in the celebrated Consolato del Mare,\n3\nprevailing in the Mediterranean, and established, in concert with other trading states and countries, by the Venetians and Genoese, in the periods of their naval power and commercial prosperity, are collections of, and improvements on, more ancient customs and laws. Of these, the Amalfitan Code (the first and most respected of what are called, as they relate in point of time to those of the Rhodians and Romans, \u201cModern Sea Laws,\u201d) furnished the predominant and most generally received principles.\n4\nThe laws of Oleron, occupy now a portion of the famous Black Book of the British Admiralty. which is consulted by all their courts on subjects of maritime and commercial controversy. These laws of Oleron were not entirely of British growth. They were compiled at -first, as French authors assert, and from the face of them it would seem probable, by Queen Eleonora, Duchess of Gui-enne, for her continental dominions, and afterwards improved and enlarged by her son Richard the First, \u2022 of England, in no small degree from the maritime laws and customs, not only of his own counlry, but also from the laws and customs prevailing among the continental trading nations. Of these, the Saxons were, at an early period, the most conspicuous and practically intelligent in nautical affairs. They introduced into England their maritime knowledge, as they did some valuable principles of the common law. What was entitled, the Saxon shore, extended from the western parts of Denmark, to the western parts of France. The excellence and importance of these laws of Oleron, are evinced by a contest for their origin between two great nations, who have wisdom and liberality enough to follow them, be the fact of origin how it may. The maritime ordinances of France \u2022 (where also the laws of Oleron, or Roll d\u2019Oleron, are in force, and claimed, as of French origin) are very mueli grounded on the sea laws of other nations, mixed with their own. Those of Louis the Fourteenth, were compiled under the direction of the great minister Colbert, from such materials, with local additions, suited to that country. The laws of the Hanse Towns,\n5\nare nearly in substance the same with those called the laws of Wisbuy, and both are principally founded on those of Oleron. The sea laws of Spain are. in no small degree, collections from those of other nations. There is a striking similarity in the leading principles of all these laws. So far from sound principles becoming obsolete, or injured by time, that it will be found, on careful investigation, that the oldest sea laws we know, those of the Rhodians,\n6\nhave furnished the outline and leading character of the whole. With such examples before us, we need not hesitate to be guided by the rules and principles, established in the maritime laws of other countries. As the ocean is common, it is proper and essentially convenient, that its laws should be also eom-mon to all who travel this \u201chigh road of nations.\u201d\nI shall not contend with those who say, we ought to have a maritime code of our own, about the binding force of all these laws on us. By the general laws of nations we certainly are bound. These apply, most frequently, in the prize court; but there are many eases of salvage, wreck, &c. on the instance or civil side of the court, which necessarily must bo determined under the general law. The wisdom and experience, evidenced in the particular maritime institutions of other commercial countries, ought at least to be greatly respected. If they serve only as faithful guides, and tried and long established rules of decision, in similar cases, they are of high and exemplary importance. It must be granted, that it is safer to follow them, than to trust entirely to the varying and crooked line of discretion.\n7\nWhere a reciprocity of decision, in certain cases, is necessary, the court of one country is often guided by the customs, laws, and decisions of the tribunals of another, in similar cases. But the change in the form of our government has not abrogated all the laws, customs and principles of jurisprudence, we inherited from our ancestors, and possessed at the period of our becoming an independent nation. The people of these states, both individually and collectively, have the common law,\n8\nin all cases, consistent with the change o\u00ed our government, and the principles on which it is founded. They possess, in like manner, the maritime law, which is part of the common law, existing at the same period; and this is peculiarly within the cognizance of courts, invested with maritime jurisdiction; although it is referred to, in all our courts on maritime questions. It is, then, not to be disputed, on sound principles, that this court must be governed in its decisions, by the Maritime Code we possessed at the period before stated; as well as by the particular laws since established by our own government, or which may hereafter be enacted. These laws and the decisions under them, must be received as authorities, in this, and other courts of our country \u201cin all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,\u201d to which, by the constitution, it is declared \u201cthe judicial power of the United States shall extend.\u201d Nor shall I think myself warranted to exclude more modern expositions, or adjudged cases from being produced here. Whatever may, in strictness, be thought of their binding authority, I shall always be ready to hear the opinions of the learned and wise jurispru-dents or judicial characters of any country. On subjects agitated in this court, often deeply affecting the property and reputation of the suitors, I am not so confident in my own judgment, as not to wish for all the lights and information, it may be in my power to obtain, from any respectable sources. If, in any instance, the laws or the decisions under them, shall be found or deemed severe, or not suited to a particular exigency or course of trade, parties may mould their contracts at their will, according to circumstances, by mutual agreement and consent. Let the law be what it may, \u201cmodus et con-ventio vincunt legem,\u201d in all contracts, not radically against common justice, moral and political obligations, and those principles which the law will not suffer to be destroyed or perverted for private purposes.\n9\nIf under a contract, by a casualty, a particular inconvenience arises from the general principles of the maritime law, the party must submit. He must consider what he loses or pays as a contribution to the great and general interests of commerce, or the predominant policy and advantage of his country.\n10\n3 II Consolato del Mare. These are the most ancient, celebrated and authentic sea laws, after those of the Rhodians. Greeks, and Romans. Yet Hubner. because he found (as Emerigon alleges), a passage in them contradictory to a favorite dogma, vituperates and deprecates them, to his own disgrace, and not to their disparagement. As a respectable part of the laws of nations. they have always been received in the English courts of admiralty, and those of this country. Their origin is enveloped in obscurity, though attributed to several nations, as well as to the Pisans, to whom a modern author la-bours to ascribe them. Their influence, value and authority, have been appreciated by claims to their origin, set up by various people of maritime countries. Those laws have prevailed in the countries occupying the coasts of 'the Mediterranean. and in the neighbouring parts of Southern Europe, for centuries. Although some special and local laws exist, in several national districts of that region, yet the Consolato del Mare is. to this day. the leading directrix, in their maritime jurisprudence, and naval affairs. This body of maritime law i\u00bb a compilation \u201cof the best maritime laws then existing, comprising judicial proceedings, principles and decisions. settled by men of great experience and consummate prudence; who. having reason and custom for their guides, established these excellent regulations, concerning navigation and maritime contracts.\u201d It may, indeed, be called the \u201cCommon Law of Maritime Europe,\u201d where it is universally adopted and respected.\n4 The city of Amalfi was situate in. what is now called, the province of Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples. Nothing great remains of it, but its celebrity for the most extensive commerce of its time, its immense wealth and magnificence. and its great weight in all questions of maritime concern. Like the Rhodians, the Amalfitans furnished principles for the codes of other maritime countries of Southern Europe. These remain engrafted into the laws of other nations; though the Amalfitan Code. or. as it is sometimes called, \u201cTable.\u201d is not preserved. To the Amalfitans. the invention of the mariner\u2019s compass is ascribed. Dr. Robertson gives the discovery to a native of Amalphi. But no opinion about ancient transactions, seems to be at rest. Azuni says, the French invented \u2014 the Amalfitans improved \u2014 and the Portuguese perfected. this compass, in their discoveries of the New World. The Chinese forestall the whole, in the antiquity of their claims, to this most eminent of all useful inventions. The Pisans and the Amalfitans share the credit of the discovery and preservation of the Pandects of Justinian, after their having been long buried in obscurity, during the barbarous ages.\n5 The laws of the Hanse Towns were published first in 1591, and reviewed in 1614, and posterior to those of Wisbuy or Oleron. The history of this commercial confederacy is well known. Although in itself and its dependencies, it consisted of 02 cities, originally, it is now reduced to six. consisting of Lubeck, Ham-burgh, Dantzig, Bremen. Rostock, and Cologne. Its existence to this day. in \u2022 any state of respectable combination, is a singular instance of survivorship over the ravages of time, the jealousies of powerful nations, and the exposure to interior danger and dissension; to which all multitudinous associations, whether national or individual, are constantly, often fatally, liable.\n6 In a note to the case of Walton v. The Neptune [Case No. 17.135]. it will appear, that Azuni, in his book on Maritime Law collects all the authorities for and against the authenticity of the fragments of Rhodian laws, published by Simon Scardius and others, and continued to our time, in collections of sea laws as gen-nine. Azuni declares them spurious. But although, according to him, these may not be genuine, as to the text and very words (which other respectable writers either impliedly \u00f3r positively assert they are) they contain many of the principles we see in other codes and works. Azuni allows, agreeahly to a cloud of authorities he could not controvert, that \u201cthe Rhodian Laws, whatever may be the period of their pub-iication, are the fountain of maritime jurisnrn-dence.\u201d 1 Azuni, Mar. Law (New York Ed. 1806) 277. The Rhodians applied themselves ex-clnsively to commerce, and avoided every idea of extension of territory. Their fleet was so powerful, and their naval regulations so excellent, that they were courted by the most mighty nations of their time They held the empire of the sea, and by confining their strength and resources to maritime objects, they not only protected and extended their own commerce, but scoured the ocean of pirates who annoyed the trade of all countries. Alexander the Great treated them with marked distinction. The Romans were their admirers, allies, and friends. These powerful islanders entitled themselves to the friendship and esteem of other commercial nations, by aiding and protecting, and not by restraining similar pursuits. Their superiority, in mercantile and naval talent and enterprise, gained them the admiration and respect of their contemporaries; when a spirit of monopoly, jealousy and plunder, would have handed them down to us. nof to be imitated, but detested.\n7 The foregoing enumeration of some of the maritime codes, is not intended to comprehend the whole, which would swell the account too extensively. It is given merely to shew, that the most renowned maritime nations always adopted the principles, when long tried and tested, of their predecessors, or contemporaries. England has not collected into a body, or code, the maritime laws by which she deems herself bound peculiarly, though she has enacted some laws, in addition to the laws or judgments of Oleron: such as the statute De Mercatoribus, the articles of Quinsborough. the acts relative to the powers of the admiralty, her navigation act, prize acts, &c. Her law merchant, and that part of it relating .to assurances particularly, as well as maritime law, are chiefly collected in the decisions of her courts. These are founded on usages and established customs, as well of her own, as of all countries possessing respectable codes or principles of maritime la w. When they arc duly canvassed, and have stood the test of time and sound discussion, they become part of their common law. and settled as precedents of indisputable authority. In their courts, respectable foreign jurists and publicists are cited, and their reasonings, opinions, and statements regarded, in the decision of maritime auestions* Such has also been the practice in the courts, particularly of maritime jurisdiction, of our country. Holland, though its existence depended on commerce, has never had any peculiar national code of maritime laws, \u2014 possibly owing to the division of her territory into separate provinces.\n8 The feudal parts of this law, and such as are inconsistent with the principles of our government are not. nor can they be, in force. Those who are best acouainted with its wise and just principles, as they relate to contracts, and the property, as well as the personal rights of individuals, admire the common law as the venerable and solid bulwark of both liberty and property. Statute laws innovating upon it, have seldom been found, on experience, to be real improvements. Those who do not know the common law supDOse it to be everything, that it is not. Its rules and principles are not arbitrary, but fixed and settled by the wisdom and decisions of the most respectable and intelligent sages, of both ancient and modern times. Many of the objections raised against it shew a want of acquaintance with its system and principles. Some of these objections are founded in innovation made by statutes altering or obscuring, the common law. Others have nothing in either common or statute law to suim-port them.\n9 The conditions of bonds, or considerations of promises, or agreements in contracts accounted illegal and void, are numerous and well known to lawyers. A contract cannot be legally binding which defeats its own object \u2014 such as that no suit shall be brought at all for a bona fide debt, agreed to be paid \u2014 a condition in a deed to do'an act malum in se, as to beat, or kill a man, or commit any crime \u2014 insurance on a illegal voyage \u2014 bonds for general restraint of trade are void, though good where the condition is not to carry it on in any particular place \u2014a bond to a third person that the obligor, a witness, shall not prosecute one confined for felony, perjury, &c. and many other instances which might be given. A bond with impossible conditions is absolute, and the condition a nullity. An agreement or contract not to bring a suit to enforce performance is, if made at the time, well. But if made posterior to the bond, contract or agreement, it amounts to a general release.\n10 The cause, in which the foregoing opinion was delivered, was of a mixed character. Part of the complainants were foreigners, and bound to return home with the ship, although with a view to sail out of our port, at our high wages, they endeavored on pretext of deviation, to obtain their discharge. The cause was dismissed as to them \u2014 they were referred to their own courts for decision. \"Wages were decreed to two American seamen, who were by contract to be discharged here.

During the progress of the cause, the following opinion was given by the district judge.\n\u201cAn objection is made, though not very' seriously pressed, to my decision on a point, on which our own municipal laws are silent. This objection, however, obliges me to give my sentiments on the question, \u2018What laws or rules shall direct or govern the decisions of maritime courts here, in points on which we have no regulations established by our own national legislature?\u2019 There are, in most nations concerned in commerce, municipal and local laws relative to contracts with mariners, and other maritime covenants and agreements; though the great leading principles, or outlines, are in all nearly the same. On this account among others. I have avoided taking cognizance, as much as possible, of disputes in which foreign ships and seamen, are concerned. I have in general, left them to settle their differences before their own tribunals. On several occasions, I have seen it part of the contract, that the mariners should not sue in any other than their own courts; \u2014 and I consider such a contract lawful. It would be against law, and void, if it were, that the mariner should not sue in any case; or, that he should not sue in the proper court, or courts of his country. But where the voyage of a foreign ship ended here, or was broken up, and no treaty or compact designated the mode of proceeding, I have permitted suits to be prosecuted. In such cases. I have determined according to the laws of the country to which .the ship belonged, if there existed any peculiar variance or difference from those generally prevailing. I have seldom found any very material difference in principle. The laws and customs of Spain,\n2\nrelating to mariners, are more rigid than those of other nations, on similar points. Among other points of variance from other laws, those of Spain grant the master, a lien on the ship, for his wages. In the present case, the contract was in part, with mariners of the United States; and these seamen were to be discharged in an American port. X apply the authority of this court to the case of our own citizens. If by our own municipal laws, there are rules established. our courts are bound exclusively to follow them. But in cases where no such rules are instituted, we must resort to the regulations of other maritime countries, which have stood the test of time and experience. to direct our judgments, as rules of decision. We ought not to betray so much vanity, as to take it for granted, that we could establish more salutary and useful regulations than those which have, for ages, governed the most commercial and powerful nations, and led them to wealth and greatness.\nCase No. 13,949.\nAdmiralty Jurisdiction \u2014 Maritime Codes.\n1.

Converting a ship from her original destination, with intent to commit hostilities ; or in other words, converting a merchant ship into a vessel of war, must be deemed act original outfit; for the act would, otherwise, become nugatory and inoperative. It is the conversion from the peaceable use, to the warlike purpose,. that constitutes the offence.\nThe vessel in question arrived in this port, with a cargo of coffee and sugar, from the West-Indies ; and so appears to have been employed by her owner with a view to merchandise, and not with a view to war. The enquiry, therefore, is limitted to this consideration, whether, after her arrival, she was fitted out, in order to cruise against any foreign nation, being at peace with the United Slates. It is true, she left the wharf with only four guns, the number that fire had brought into the port; but it is equally true, that, when she had dropped to some distance below, she took on board three or four guns more, a number of muskets, water-casks &c. ; and, it is manifest, that other guns, ready to be sent to her by the Pilot-boat. These circumstances clearly prove a conversion from the original. commercial design of the vessel, to a design of cruising against the enemies of France ; and, of course, against a nation, at peace with the United States, since the United States are at peace with all the world. Nor can it be reasonably contended, that the articles thus put on board the vessel were article's of merchandise ; for, if that had been the case, they would have been mentioned in her manifest, on clearing out of the port, whereas it is expressly stated, that she sailed in ballast. If they were not to be used for merchandise, the inference is inevitable, that they were to be used for war. No man would proclaim on the house top, that he intended to fit out a privateer : the intention must be collected from all the circumstances of the transaction which the Jury will investigate, and on which they must decide. . But if they are of opinion, that it was intended to convert this vessel from a merchant ship into a cruiser, every man who was knowingly concerned in doing so, is guilty in the contemplation of the law.\nIt will only, then, be necessary to ascertain, how far the defendant was knowingly, concerned ; for, though he were concerned,, if he did not ad with a knowledge of the real object, he would be innocent. It has been alledged in his defence, that he was merely an interpreter; and if, in fact, he had appeared in that character alone, we should not have thought it a sufficient ground for conviction. But the Jury will collect from the other parts of the transaction, whether this is not used as a mask to cover his efficient agency in the equipment of the vessel. He carried orders from the owner to the ship carpenter; he told the Pilot-boy at what time the guns should be taken on board his boat, to be carried to the ship ; the account found in his possession states charges for supplies of cannon, ball, muskets, and commissions for services ; and the whole is conducted in a secret and myterious manner, under the shade of night. Would he have acted this part as a mere interpreter ? If it had been fair mercantile business, involving nothing repugnant to our laws, would it have been so much a work of darkness ? This alone casts a gloom over the transaction, that will impress every just and ingenuous mind with an idea of fraud and delinquency.\nIf the defendant has been concerned in the offence, there is no doubt that it is effected as far as it was in his power to complete it. The illegal outfit of the vessel was accomplished ; and that an additional number of cannon was not sent to augment her force, was nor owing to his respect to the laws, but to the vigilance of the public police.\nUpon the whole, the Jury will consider the indictment ; and give such a verdict as shall comport with evidence and law.\nVerdict\u2014Guilty.", "author": "Jitftice:", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [".Levy, for the defendant.", "Rawle, the Diftrift Attorney,"], "head_matter": "The Unites States versus Guinet, et al.\n.Levy, for the defendant.\nRawle, the Diftrift Attorney,\nTHIS was an indictment against Etienne Guinet and John Baptist Le Maitre, for a misdemeanor in sitting out and arming Les Jumeaux (The Twins) in the port of Philadelphia, to be employed in the service of the Republic of France, against Great Britain, both powers being at peace with the United States. The act on which the indictment was founded, contained the following sections :\nSec. 3. And be it further enacted and declared, That if any person shall, within any of the ports, harbours, bays, rivers, or other Waters of the United States, sit out and arm, or attempt to sit out and arm, or procure to be sitted out and armed, or shall knowingly be concerned in the furnishing, sitting out or arming of any ship or vessel, with intent that such ship or vessel shall be employed in the service of any Foreign Prince or State, to cruise or commit hostilities upon the subjects, citizens or property of another Foreign Prince or State, with whom the United States are at peace, or shall issue or deliver a commission within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, for any ship or vessel, to the intent that she may be employed as aforesaid, every such person, so offending, shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of a high misdemeanor, and shall be fined and imprisoned, at the discretion of the Court in which the conviction shall be had, so as the fine to be imposed shall in no case be more than five thousand dollars, and the term of imprisonment shall not exceed three years ; and every such ship or vessel, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture, together with all materials, aims, ammunitions, and stores, which may have been procured for the building and equipment thereof, shall be forfeited, one half to the use of any person who shall give information of the offence, and the other half to the use of the United States.\nSec. 4. And be it further enacted and declared, That if any person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, encrease or augment, or procure to be encreased or augmented, or shall be knowingly concerned in encreasing or augmenting the force of any ship of war, cruiser, or other armed vessel, which, at the time of her arrival within the United States, was a ship of war, cruiser or armed vessel in the service of a Foreign Prince or State, or belonging to the subjects or citizens of such Prince or State, the same being at war with another Foreign Prince or State with whom the United States are at peace by adding to the number or size of guns of such vessel prepared for use, or by the addition thereto of any equipment solely applicable to war, every such person so offending shall, upon conviction, be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined and imprisoned at the discretion of the Court, in which the conviction shall be had, so as that such fine shall not exceed one thousand dollars, nor the term of imprisonment be more than one year.\nThe indictment was brought upon the 3d section. Guinet only was apprehended ; and, being arraigned, he pleaded not guilty.\n<The material fafts that appeared in evidence, upon trial, were thefe : Les Jumeaux entered at the port of Philadelphia, in the month of , laden with fugar and coffee, from Port-au-Prince; and on her arrival she mounted four guns and two swivels. The vessel, it seemed, had originally been a British cutter, employed in the trade to the coast of Guinea ; and had ten port-holes on each side, though only four were actually open, at the time of her arrival, to accommodate the four guns, then mounted. Soon after, a Frenchman applied to a ship-carpenter to repair the vessel, which was in a very rotten state ; and, after some difficulty, a bargain for that purpose was struck ; but the carpenter declared he would only open the number of ports (twenty) which were pierced when she came into port ; and in all other respects fit her for a merchant-ship. At thtime of repairing her, she was owned in shares by Le Maitre, the original owner, and seven other Frenchmen. The twenty ports being opened, and the other repairs of the vessel proceeding rapidly, the Government instituted an enquiry into the subject, in order to ascertain the nature and design of her equipments. On examination, the matter Warden found the vessel in great forwardness, her twenty ports open, her upper deck changed, &c. and four iron guns on carriages, with two swivels, were lying on the adjoining wharf. He, therefore, desired the carpenter to desist from working any further on the vessel, and made a report on the subject, to the Secretary at War ; who directed, that all the recent equipments of a warlike nature should be dismantled, and the vessel restored to the state in which she was when she arrived. The matter Warden, accordingly, caused the port holes to be shut up, and even refused to allow any ringbolts to be fixed in the vessel. A few days before she left the port a witness said he saw four guns in hehatch-way ; the carpenter who repaired her said she carried with her from the wharf, the four guns and two swivels that she had brought in ; and, according to the Custom-House Entry, she sailed from the city in ballast, having nothing in her hold but provisions, water-casks, and wood for the ship\u2019s use. It had been said, at one time, that she was to carry flour; at another time that she was to carry passengers ; and Guinet had told the ship carpenter that she would be advertised on freight. She failed in the middle of the day, and some of the workmen went down in her as far as League-Island.\n'It appeared, likewife, that ihe came to, . at. Wilmington ; that an apprentice to the Pilot on board of her, was left behind in . order to carry on fome guns, cordage, and bedding ; that accordingly, he, in company with his matter, (who had returned from Wilmington, after piloting the vefiel thither) two or three Frenchmen that belonged to the vefiel, and two black boys, carried and delivered on board, three or four carriage guns; that the witnefs (who did not go on board) faw no appearance of other guns, which he- could have done, though it was dark, had there been port-holes and the guns run out; that the Pilot boat returned to Philadelphia the fame night, for the purpofe of carrying to the ihip fome of her. crew, and two or three hog\u00edheads; that the hog&eads were put on board the Pilot-boat- the next day, and being there opened were found to be filled with a number of little kegs, the contents of which were unknown ; that at the fame time twenty or thirty mufkets, a number of lanterns, cans, &c. were put on board ; that the whole of this tranfaction took place in the night time, b\u00e9tween 10 and 11 o\u2019clock ; and that, during the fame night, the Pilot-boat, with three or four Frenchmen on board, puihed from the wharf, and, failed down to Wilmington, where the vefiel ftilllay; that the things brought in the Pilot-boat being put oh board the fhip, ihe got under weigh and proceeded to Reedy-Ifand; that there were then between thirty and forty perfons on board; that the witnefs could hot perceive that ihe had any guns or gun carriages on deck, though this might be owing t\u00f3 \u2019 its being- dark; that the vefiel dropt down to New-Caftk ; and the Pilot-boat was again fent to Philadelphia, hy order of an officer (as it would feem) belonged to the vefiel, who met the witnefs there, and between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock at night, put one or two trunks and a large-box on board the Pilot-boat, at South-ftreet wharf \u215d that there were then lying on the wharf fix guns without carriages, which Gui-net told the witnefs he mutt take on board the Pilot-boat,, at 12 o\u2019clock at night; that the matts were foweak, that the witnefs. was at firft afraid to undertake it ; that he went, however, to borrow a runner and tackle from an adjoining iloop ; that Guinet concluded to poftpone heaving the guns into the boat \u2019till the next evening; and in the intermediate time the Marflhall feized the guns and boat, and apprehended the parties\nThis was the amount of the general evidence relating to the equipment of the vessel, and the evidence particularly pointed against the defendant, Guinet, was to the following effect :\u2014While the vessel was. repairing, Guinet was seen frequently attending the people at work ; and the master Warden, before whom be had attended with the owner, understood that he acted in the character of an interpreter, as the owner could not speak English. The ship-carpenter did not see Guinet \u2019till the bargain was struck, and the repairs were considerably advanced ; that afterwards when the owner came, which was generally twice, a day, he spoke so little English, that Guinet used to translate for him, and on all occasions act as his interpreter ; that Guinet sometimes brought orders from the owner to the carpenter; that he never assumed any right of ownership himself, but, on the contrary, once complained to the carpenter, that the owners had not given him so much as a hat for interpreting. In opposition, however, to the idea of his being merely an interpreter, it was proved, that when the Marshall seized the Pilot-boat, Guinet claimed one of the trunks on board, and declared, that the guns lying on the wharf belonged to him, he having, as he alledged. purchased them, to sell again as merchandise. A runner and tackle was sent on board while the Pilot-boat was in the Marshall\u2019s custody, but it has never been claimed. Guinet denied before the Judge, on his examination, that he knew any thing more of the Pilot-boat, than that she was going to New-Castle, and he had put his baggage on board to send thither ; but the Pilot\u2019s apprentice being confronted with him, insisted that he was the person who had ordered the fix cannon to be taken on board, and that he was acquainted with the transaction. When, likewise,was apprehended, two papers were found , in his possession : one of them was an account, stated in his own hand writing, between Le Maitre and himself, in which were charges for supplying musquets, ball, and cannon ; for monies advanced at sundry times on account of the equipments ; and for commissions and attendance in superintending the repairs and outfit of the vessel. The other paper was a letter from Meffrs. Mendenhall & Co. of Wilmington, to Guinet, dated the 20th of December, 1794, containing the following passage: \u201c Your favor per post is come to hand. We think it not possible to get any 4lb. shot, or any other size here. We think it probable, that we can let one of our boats go down with the things for the ship ; they have taken the water casks on board already. The account shall be ready against you call.\u201d The Deputy Collector proved the Manifest of the sloop Farmer, which brought up fix guns, consigned from Mendenhall & Co. to Guinet; and Guinet acknowledged before the Judge, that the guns lying at South-street wharf were those that had been fo consigned to him.\nThis is the first prosecution that has occurred since an act of Congress was passed on the subject. Before the act was passed an important and interesting controversy had arisen between the Executive of the Federal Government, and the French Minister ; in the course of which the latter contended, that, if not by the general law of nations, at least by positive compact, the French Republic Was entitled to repair and equip vessels of war in the ports of the United States ; since the Treaty, by making it expressly unlawful for the others, had, by necessary implication, made it lawful for her. Treaty Art. 22. As a branch of this controversy, it had, likewise, been insisted, that an American citizen had a right to enter into the service of the French Republic ; and the position certainly received some countenance, from the refusal of a Grand Jury in Boston to find Bills of lndictment against persons who had acted in that manner, and from the acquittal of Gideon Hempfield by a Philadelphia Jury. These interpretations and proceedings were, however, disapproved by our Executive,; who, on the first point, contrary to the avowed sense of the great mass of the people, construed the 22d article of the Treaty, to be merely an exclusion of other belligerent nations from the privilege of equipping in our ports, and not a permission to France ; and this diversity of sentiment between the Government and the Citizens, finally produced the act of Congress now in question. The section on which this prosecution is founded is, indeed, a severe and penal one ; but, in proportion to the rigor of the punishment, will a conscientious Jury require the degree of proof to be. It contemplates four descriptions of offence: 1st. To fit out and arm, or attempt to fit out and arm ; 2d. To procure to be fitted but and armed ; 3d. To be concerned, knowingly, in furnishing, fitting out, or arming any ship or vessel, with intent that such ship or vessel shall be employed in the service of any Foreign Prince or State, to cruise or commit hostilities upon a nation at peace with the United States. And 4th. To issue or deliver a commission within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States for any ship or vessel, to the intent that she may be so employed. Two facts, then, are essential to justify a conviction. 1st. The vessel must have been fitted out and armed within the port of Philadelphia. And 2d. The defendant must, at least, have been knowingly concerned in her equipment, 1st. With respect to the first fast, there is no direct proof that the vessel sailed with more guns than she brought with her ; and the mere intention to arm and equip her is not criminal. Nor even if cannon, arms and ammunition had been put on board, does it follow, as a necessary consequence, that it was intended to arm her as a vessel of war in the service of France, to cruise against the friends of America. There is no evidence of such cruising ; nor of the design, (whether as passengers or mariners) with which the thirty or forty persons were on board the vessel; and military stores may lawfully be sold here, or be exported to Foreign Countries by American citizens : the act is only punishable when the armament and stores are applied to the use of the vessel in which they are Clipped. But the most that can possibly be inferred from the evidence, is an augmentation of the force of the vessel, as she arrived here with guns actually mounted ; and then the indictment should have been founded on the 4th, instead of the 3d section, of the act. There is a great difference; in the language and penalties of the two sections, which undoubtedly arose from the very different nature of the cases, to which they respectively apply. For, it is neither so offensive in itself, nor so dangerous to the peace of the nation, that a vessel already armed should add something to its force, as that a vessel should originally be constructed and equipped within our ports, for the purposes of war. Hence, therefore, the bare attempt in the latter cases made criminal; but in the former the unlawful act must be consummated. The words of the 4th section refer to ships of war, cruisers, or other armed vessels : all the writers on the subject state, that there are four kinds of armed vessels, three with commissions, and one without commission, to wit\u2014vessels of war, privateers,letters of marque, and all other armed vessels ; and this vessel must be included in the last description,not being embraced by the others. 2d. With respect to the second essential fact, there is not sufficient evidence to shew, that the defendant was knowingly concerned in the illegal outfit of the vessel. He acted only as an interpreter; which, notwithstanding the generality of the word, concerned, cannot fairly be included in the definition of an offence, that calls for proof of a serious intention to furnish and outfit the vessel. There was no crime in being owner of the guns at South-street wharf ; and the object in ordering them to be put on board the Pilot-boat does not appear. The transaction with Mendenhall & Co. rather proves that the guns were not intended for this vessel, as it would have been easier, more expeditious; and safer, in that case, to send them on board from Wilmington, with the water-casks, and other articles, which were actually sent by them. The account found in the defendant\u2019s possession, relates to the disbursements of a factor for his principal:\u2014It is not shewn how it arose; whether before or after the articles were received; and after a vessel illegally equipped has failed, it cannot be an offence within the act, to pay drafts in discharge of the trades-men\u2019s bills. Presumptions unfavorable to innocence; ought not to be encouraged in a case fo highly penal.\nentered into a description of the principles and advantages of an honorable neutrality; and relied upon the good-sense and patriotism of the Jury, to prevent their being seduced by a retrospective view of the popular prejudices that had formerly prevailed. He then contended 1st. That the offence had been committed ; 2d. That the defendant was knowingly concerned in committing it ; and 3d. That the indictment was founded on the proper section of the act of Congress.\n1st. There is evidence, that the vessel sailed from the wharf with the guns that s ihe brought into port; that four other guns with military stores were, afterwards put on board of her, and that she had a crew of thirty or forty persons. It is arming a vessel, when arms are put on board, she being on her passage ; and it cannot be material, that those arms should be arranged in a particular manner., As to the design of the equipment, there is no proof of an actual cruise ; but the Jury will decide, whether it was any other than that charged in the indictment. There is no attempt to prove that she had a cargo, or carried passengers ; on the contrary, it is in evidence that she sailed in ballast ; and the subdivisions of interest in the vessel are in the nature of all ownership of privateers.\n2d. The defendant was knowingly concerned. As furnishing arms, knowing them to be designed for an unlawful purpose, constitutes the crime ; and as an interpreter was the necessary instrument on the occasion ; even if the defendant, had appeared in no other character, this would have been sufficient to convict him. But he was not merely an interpreter ;\u2014he appears to have interfered on various other occasions; and his account is conclusive evidence of a confidential and important agency in accomplishing the illegal outfit of the vessel. It might afford some color of defence, to say, that he only attempted to send the cannon on board from South-street wharf, if this account did not demonstrate that he was concerned in the equipment from the beginning. There is nothing to justify, an idea, that it arose from paying drafts, after the vessel had failed ; but on the contrary several items are for money advanced ; and the charge for commissions, &c. has relation to the very moment of commencing the repairs. The agency proved by the account is corroborated by the purchase of cannon from Mendenhall & Co. which is evidently connected with the general plan for equipping this vessel.\n3d. The indictment is well laid ; the 2d section is the only one to which the case is applicable. The 4th section refers only to the augmentation of the force of the vessel. which on her arrival in our ports, was, in fact, a vessel of war, either public or private. If, therefore, a man of war or privateer adds to the number or size of her guns, or makes any equipment solely applicable to war, it is an offence against this section. But if a vessel, having guns on board, and yet being neither a man of war, nor a privateer, enters our ports, she cannot legally, be equipped for the purposes of war. Without this construction, the act of Congress would be nugatory ; as it might be evaded by bringing a single gun in the vessel. In the present case, it appears that Les Jumeaux had been employed in the Guinea-trade; that she arrived here with a cargo of sugar and cotton-; and being converted from a merchant vessel, carrying a few guns for self defence, into a privateer armed for hostilities, it is clearly an Original outfit within the meaning of the law. The distinction is justified by this further consideration, that the 3d section makes arming the vessel, with intent to employ her in hostilities, the offence ; whereas the 4th section refers nothing to the intent with which the force of the vessel is augmented, as it only contemplates the case of vessels originally fitted for war by the nation to which they belong."}}}, {"id": 11746982, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11746982/", "name": "Parasset versus Gautier", "name_abbreviation": "Parasset v.

But, as the matter appears to this Court, I perfectly concur in the sentiments, which have been delivered by Judge Patterson.\nThe order to hold the defendant to bail, was, accordingly, affirmed.", "author": "Patterson, Justice \u25a0Peters, JuJlice:", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": ["M.

Lenfy, for the plaintiff,\nDu Ponceau, for the defendant,\nA CAPIAS had issued in this suit, returnable to the present Term ; but previously to the return of the writ, there had been a hearing before Judge Peters, at his chambers, upon a citation to shew cause, why the defendant should not be discharged on common bail; the Judge had ordered bail to be given ; and the defendant had appealed from this order to the Court. The merits of the appeal were now discussed ; and, independent of some circumstances relating to the origin of the debt (which the Court said ought not to weigh upon a question of bail\n*\n) the material facts appeared to be these :\u2014An action had been instituted in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, between the same parties, for the same cause ; and on a hearing before Chief Justice M\u2018Kean, the defendant was ordered to be discharged on common bail. From that order the plaintiff did not appeal ; but afterwards applied by motion to the Supreme Court, for a rule upon, the defendant to enter special bail. This the Court refused ; because they would not take cognizance of the subject, but by way of appeal from the decision of the Chief Justice ; and the proper time for making such an appeal had elapsed. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff discontinued his action in the State Court, and brought the present acion here. It also, appeared, that the plaintiff (who was a Foreigner, ignorant of our laws) had not originally employed an attorney to appear before Chief Justice M'Kean, though the person that then attended him, pretended to have a competent knowledge of legal proceedings.,\ncontended that bail ought to be given. Nothing, short of a judgment, can be a perpetual bar in personal actions; .and, therefore, the certificate of a discharge on common bail by the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, was not binding upon the Judge of this Court, who had given a different order. The person, character, and legal talents, of that Judge could not be taken into view. The Justices of the Courts of Common. Pleas possess a concurrent jurisdiction, without possessing a spark of his jurisprudential knowledge ; and yet if his discharge is conclusive, so likewise must theirs be.\n*\nActions are often commenced after non-suits ; and, it is clear, that the second Court is not bound, in such cases, nor even in cases where a decision may have been had on the merits, by the opinion of a first Court, It is true, that every species of vexation should be discountenanced ; but every mistake ought not to be interpreted into an act of vexation. The plaintiff was ill-advised in the mode of presenting his case to the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania ; and, considering his ignorance of our laws, he ought not to lose the benefit of bail, by the laches of his agent, in not pursuing the technical form of an appeal. Nor is the discontinuance of the former action, under these circumstances, to be imputed to him as matter of malice and persecution. If the plaintiff\u2019s motive was originally just and commendable, to recover a bona fide, debt, the allegation of any subsequent impropriety must be manifested by some fact : now, if he was ever fairly entitled to hold the defendant to bail, the discharge can furnish no ground to accuse the plaintiff of vexation for endeavouring, by various means, to accomplish that object; and, after the State Court had refused to interpose, he must either abandon that object, or discontinue his suit, and resort to another tribunal. A man may commence a suit as often as he pleases ; and may hold his debtor twenty different times to bail, if any reasonable cause can be assigned for so withdrawing and renewing the process of the law. No argument to the contrary, can be founded on 2 Wills. 381 ; for, bail Was there refused on the second action, because it had not been asked in the first. Vexation must flow from a worse source than ignorance, or accident : it is generally instigated by malice ; and always characterized by vigilance. In the present case, there is no symptom of malice ; and the want of vigilance has alone produced the plaintiff\u2019s embarrassment.\nadmitted, that when a discontiuance took place, without any vexatious design or effect, either in consequence of a mistake in the nature of the action, or of an attorney\u2019s flip in the form of conducing it, bail mighbe ordered in the second action, for the same cause : But he contended, that when a question has been decided by one tribunal, another tribunal of co-ordinate jurisdiction will not take cognizance of it, except in the regular course of a judicial appeal. He urged, likewise, that the circumstances of instituting and discontinuing an action in the State Court, were prima facie evidence of vexation, that required a better explanation and excuse\nthan have been given ; and to these he added the change of the tribunal. But he particularly insisted, that the neglect of appealing from the order of Chief Justice McKean, was his own laches, which he ought not to be allowed to remedy by transfering the suit to another Court, at the expence of his antagonist. 2 Wils. 381.\n* Patterson, Justice :\u2014If you make it a question of fraud in the original contract, or in the assignment, the Court cannot enquire into it, upon, a question of bail.

The principle that must govern such preliminary investigations rests here ; if a reasonable cause of action is shewn, the defendant ought to be held to bail.\n* Patterson, Justice:\u2014The certificate of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania is produced as evidence of vexation, on the part of the plaintiff ; and not to bind the judgment of the Court."}}}, {"id": 11747038, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11747038/", "name": "Geyger\u2019s Lessee versus Geyger", "name_abbreviation": "Geyger\u2019s Lessee v.

But I see not that in a liberal view and construction of the laws of the United States, on this subject, a rigid adherence to all the local and (economical regulations of the State, is directed or necessary. It should seem, that the most pointed reference was had to the designation and qualification of jurors, and not to the exact numbers of which the pannel should consist. The Legislature of a State have in their confideration a variety of local arrangements, which cannot be adapted to the more expanded policy of the nation. It never could have been in the contemplation of Congress, by any reference to State regulations, to defeat the operation of the national laws. Now, there are cases, which have been stated, in which some of the criminal laws of the United States may be rendered impracticable, by an adherence to the rule of numbers, prescribed as to jurors, in criminal cases by the State law ; and especially if there must be but one pannel, as has been contended. Yet, the most substantial requisites, to win the qualifications of jurors and mode of selection, may be adhered to. As to the clause in the law of the United States, directing, that the laws of the States (with great exceptions) shall be regarded as rules of decision, in trials at common law in the Courts of the United States,\" I do not think it applies to the case before us.\n.All the arguments founded on the inconveniences to -the d'e-, fendants, if in this cafe particularly'any fuch-exift (of which T much doubt) weigh lightly when fet again.fi: the delays and ob-ftruftions which the objeflion would throw-in the way of the execution of the laws of the nation. ' *\nPatterson, Justice:\n\u2014The objections that have been suggested on this occasion, are principally founded on the 29th section of the judicial act of Congress, which refers the Federal Courts to the State laws, for certain regulations respecting juries. But the words of this reference are clearly restricted to the mode of designating the jury, by lot, or otherwise, and to the qualifications which are requisite for jurors; according to the laws and practice of the respective States. Since, therefore; the act of Congress dies not itself fix the number of jurors ; nor expressly adopt any State rule for the purpose, it is a necessary consequence that the subject must depend on the common law; and, by the common law, the Court may direct any number of jurors to be summoned, on a consideration of all the circumstances under which the venire is issued. There are instances, indeed, where five juries have been summoned upon a trial for High Treason, in order that, after the allowance of the legal challenges, a competent number might still be ensured. In the present instance, the precept requires the Marshall to return at least 48 jurors 5 and he has not, in my opinion, been guilty of any excess, in the exercise of that discretion for returning a greater number, with which he is legally invested.\nNeither is the mode of making his return justly exceptionable. As the act of Congress directs that 12 jurors shall be summoned from the County, in which the offence was committed, I cannot conceive any more proper, or more legal, way of proceeding, than by issuing a venire in each case ; and then there must, of course, be a separate pannel returned, in conformity to every writ. Thus, likewise, the act of Congress and the State act have been reconciled, and both put into operation ; 12 jurors being returned in pursuance of the former, and 60 jurors being returned in pursuance of the latter, law.\nWith respect to the objection, that a copy of the caption of the indictment has not been furnished to the prisoners, it may be observed, that, although the practice of Pennsylvania has been different, yet, the caption and the indictment seem naturally to form but one instrument; and copies of both should, therefore, be delivered under the provisions of the act of Congress. There can be little inconveniency in adopting this rule ; and it is calculated to avoid much difficulty and controversy.\nThe objection, that the place of abode of the jurors and witnesses, has not been sufficiently designated, in the lifts furnished to the prisoners, is, likewise, in our opinion, a valid one. The object of the law was to enable the party accused to prepare for his defence, and to identify the jurors who were to try, and the witnesses who were to prove, the indictment against him. It is contrary to the spirit and intent of such a provision, that the whole range of the State, or of a County, should be allowed, as descriptive of a place of abode ; and it is the duty of the Judges so to mould the practice and construction of statutes, as to render them reasonable and just. With regard to the place, therefore, we think the townships in which the jurors and witnesses respectively reside, should be specified; but the act of Congress does not require a specification of their occupations, and the niceties of the State act, are not, in that respect, incorporated into the Federal system.\nIn consequence of this decision, the trials were suspended, in order to give the Attorney of the District the three days required by the act of Congress, for delivering to the prisoners, amended copies of the caption and indictment, and of the lists of jurors and witnesses.", "author": "Peters, Justice :\u2014I Patterson, Justice:", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "The United States versus The Insurgents of Pennsylvania.\nSEVERAL indictments for high treason having been found against persons concerned in the insurrection in the four Western Counties of Pennsylvania, a Venire was issued in each case, for summoning a Jury returnable to the present Term ; and to each writ the Marshall returned a separate pannel, containing the names of thirty-six Jurors, from the city of Philadelphia fifteen from the county of Delaware, nine from the county of Chester and twelve from each county, in which the treason was charged to have been committed, making seventy-two Jurors on each pannel, and one hundred and eight Jurors summoned on the whole.\nThe act of Congress (1 Vol. p. 112. s. 29) having directe\u201c that any person who shall be accused and indicted of treason, shall have a copy of the indictment, and a list of the Jury and witnesses to be produced on the trial for proving the said indictment, mentioning the names and places of abodes of such witnesses and jurors, delivered unto him at least three entire days before he shall be tried for the same,\u201d the Attorney of the District had, in due time, delivered to the several prisoners copies of the indictment, of the pannel of jurors, and of the lilt of witnesses ; but he had omitted to deliver a copy of the caption of the indictment, and to specify the occupations, or the places of abode of the jurors and witnesses, otherwise that by mentioning the counties in which the jurors respectively resided.\n.On this ftate of fa\u00e9ls, Lewis fuggefted the following except tions \u00be which, he faid, were not' fo much defigried for the exifting cafes,, as to prevent the introduction of precedents, injurious to the rights and fafety of pofterity.\n1st.

Dallas's Edit.) it is declared \u201c that every fheriff, or any officer, to whom the return of Venire Facias Juratores or other .procefs for the trial of caufes before the Judges of Oyer Terminer, general-goal-delivery, and Ni/i T\u2019nwdoth belong, fhall, upon return- thereof, unlefs in-cafes where' a fpecial Jury fhall be ftruck by rule of Court, annex a' pannel to the faid writ containing the chriflian and fur-names, additions,' and places of abode of a competent number of Jurors, the names of the fame perfons to be jnferted in the pan-nel annexed to every fuch writ, for the trial of all iffues in civil and criminal caufes at thefaid Courts, in each refpe\u00e9live county, which number of Jurors, in any County, fall not be lefs than forty-eight, nor more thanfixty, without the direction of the Judge or Judges appointed to go the Circuit, and fit as Judge or Judges of Oyer IP Terminer, general-goal-delivery, or Ni/i Pi-ius, in fuch county, who are hereby empowered and. required, if he or they fee caufe, by order, under his hand, or their hands, to \u25a0 dire\u00e9l a greater number, not to exceed eighty, &c.\u201d\nBy the same act, (s. 5.) it is further declared, \u201c that the sheriff of the county of Philadelphia, or other county where the Supreme Court of judicature shall be holden, or other officer to whom the return of the Venire Facias Juratores, or other process for the trial of causes at bar before the Justices of the Supreme Court, doth belong, shall, upon return thereof, unless in cases where a special Jury shall be struck by rule of Court, annex a pannel to the said writ, containing the christian and surnames, additions, and places of abode, of a competent number of Jurors, the names of the same persons to be inserted in the pannel annexed to every such writ, for the trial of all issues to be tried at the bar of the said Court during the ensuing Terms, which number of Jurors shall not be less than forty-eight, nor more than sixty, &c.\"\nThe hrw of the State being thus made the rule for the Federal Courts, Lewis contended, that, in no case, could the Marshall be authorized to return more than 80 Jurors ; that the power of extending the pannel to that number does not veil in the Circuit Court, fitting in its ordinary character, as the act only vests it in the Courts of Oyer & Terminer, general-goal-delivery, and Nisi Prius; but that, in the present instance, even that number, and without the order of the Court, had been far exceeded, since 12 Jurors had been summoned from each of the four counties, in which the charges were laid, and 60 had been summoned from other parts of the State, making in the whole 108, which he considered as an unnecessary as well as an expensive and oppressive call on the citizens. He insisted,that, as different charges were laid in the four counties, 48 jurors should have been summoned from them, and only the number necessary to compleat the pannel of 60, or, in case of a special order, the pannel of 80, might be summoned from any other part, of the State. In England the power of summoning Jurors is limitted to 48, unless by the special order of the Justices of Oyer & Terminer and general-goal-delivery. Keyl. 16. The act of Congress does not direct, that the 12 Jurors, to be brought from the county where the offence was committed, shall be over and beyond the 60 Jurors, directed by the State law to be summoned; nor does it permit, the Marshall to summon the Jurors whence he pleases, without the express order of the Court.\nThe return of several pannels for the trial of each issue, Lewis deemed to be equally inconsistent with the terms and policy of the Pennsylvania law, which the law of Congress had like wife adopted. Great inconveniency had been experienced from such a practice; and the State Legislature, as a reformation in the system of jurisprudence that previously prevailed, expressly enacted, that the pannel annexed to every writ of Venire Facias Juratores, should be \" for the trial of all issues to be tried at the bar of the said Court, during the said Term.\u201d\n2d. That a copy of the caption of the indictments, as well as a copy of the indictments themselves, had not been delivered to the respective prisoners.\nThe caption is material, for it must state the Judges before whom, the Grand Jury by whom, the time when, and the place where, the indictment was presented. For, if the Judges fit without a commission, or the commission has expired ; if the Grand-Jury was composed of a number less than twelve, or the members of it were not qualified according to law ;\u2014if the indictment was found at a place where the Court was not authorized to fit, or at a time when, in fact, it was not fitting, the prisoner is entitled to take advantage of the defect, and he cannot have the opportunity of doing so, unless he is furnished with the caption of his indictment. On the same principle Foster contends for the same privilege ; and declares it to be founded oh the constant practice, though the act only mentions a copy of the indictment. Fost. Cro. L. 229. And Blackstone, as well as Foster, shews that it is of importance that, the prisoner should receive the copy before arraignment, \u201c for then is his time' to take exceptions to the indictment by way of plea, or demurer.\u201d 2 Hawk. c. 25. s. 118. In reason, and in effect, the caption is apart of the indictment. Whenever it becomes necessary to exemplify the indictment, the caption must accompany it and no inferences drawn from the practice respecting indictments for other offences (where the caption is not supplied, as it is said, till the record is finally made up) can be applicable to the present question, since in no other cafe, but treason, is the delivery of a copy of the indictment prescribed as a preliminary to the trial. Nor is their any essential distinction between this Court, and the Courts to which the cited authorities relate : For, although the jurisdiction of the Court is ascertained and known, the constitutionalty of the commissions of the Judges who compose it ;\u2014the legality of the number and qualification of the Grand-Jury, who attend it ;\u2014the place of its sessions &c.\u2014will still afford ample materials for investigation and just objection.\n3d. The lists furnished to the respective prisoners, do not contain a sufficient specification of the addition and places of abode of the Jurors and witnesses.\nBy the acts of Congress (1 Vol. p. 67. s. 29. s. 28.) as well as the act of Pennsylvania (2 Vol. p. 263.) the specification of the place of abode of the Jurors, is prescribed ; and the Pennsylvania act (which is adopted by the other) calls likewise for the additions of the Jurors. It is true, that in the copy of the pannel the county is mentioned, from which the Jurors respectively are summoned ; but as the sheriff could not in a case arising under the State jurisdiction, summon any citizens as jurors, who were not inhabitants of the proper county,, the act, when it requires a specification of the place of abode, cannot surely be satisfied by merely mentioning the county. The express relation between the State and Federal laws on the subject, demands an analogous conclusion, in a case arising under the jurisdiction of the general Government; and the general reasons for furnishing such information to prisoners, acquire great additional force, from a confideration of the distance between the place of trial, and the place where the offence is charged to have been committed.\nIn answer to these exceptions Bradford (the attorney general of the United States) and Rawle (the attorney of the district) premised, that they were also impressed with the propriety and necessity of establishing, found and permanent principles on this first discussion of the doctrine of treason, as it applied to the existing constitution of the United States: But they contended.\n1st. That the exception to the number of jurors returned, and to the mode of returning separate pannels, ought not to be allowed They observed, that the leading question on this point, called for a decision, whether, when a Federal Court was referred by an act of Congress : State regulations for its government, the State law, in its strict words, or in the practice under it, should furnish the rule ? But, even from the context of the judicial act of Congress, an intention cannot reasonably be inferred, to incorporate all the provisions of the Pennsylvania act relating to jurors, into the practice of the Federal Courts. The reference to the State laws respects only the mode of designating the Jury by lot, or otherwise, and the qualification of the jurors : it does not respect the number to be returned on the pannel, which is still left (under the power of framing writs suited to the exigency of every case 1 Vol. p. 58) in the discretion of the Court, to be prescribed by Venire, or at common law. But the Pennsylvania act, without admitting such a distinction, must produce the greatest embarrassment ; for it prescribes a different number of jurors to be returned to different Courts, and there is nothing in the act of Congress to determine which, number shall be adopted here.\nThe act of Pennsylvania, however, had obviously an economical object in view, when it limited the number of jurors to sixty, as a compensation was originally allowed for their attendance, the gh it has since been repealed 5 2 Vol. Dall. Edit. p. 268 ; and the practice of the Supreme Court, it is believed, changed in consequence of the repeal. But even taking the act of Pennsylvania as an indispensable rule, it is substantially complied with. The act of Congress introduced a particular regulation for the trial of offenders, which required that twelve jurors should be taken from the county where the offence is charged to have been committed ; and this is done. The act of Pennsylvania authorized sixty jurors, to be summoned ; and in addition to the twelve from,the proper county, the Marshall has, accordingly, summoned sixty from the State at large. Teach Venire, there are no more than seventy-two jurors returned.\nThe return of a separate pannel in each case is, likewise, perfectly confident with law, practice, and public conveniency. The indictments depending are all separate; none of them are joint. The exception, however, if it is at all available, goes to the venire; and not to the pannel; for the latter is in strict conformity to the former. After the Court has prescribed that twelve of the jurors shall be brought from the proper County, the Marshall has a legal discretion to bring the rest from any part of the District that he pleases. The Court will not, and cannot, interfere with the exercise of that power, unless it becomes necessary, in order to obtain an impartial jury. There, must be as many pannels, as there are Counties, in which offences are charged to have been committed ; and if twelve jurors are taken from the proper county for each case, there can be no legal ground to object that the same sixty, to compleat the pannel of 72, are returned to all the cases. But the adverse doctrine would require the jurors to be brought from every County in which ah offence is charged. Suppose, therefore, five Counties involved, sixty jurors would, of course, be returned from them ; and if the Court (as it has been contended) cannot increase that number, then a pirate, or any other felon, charged with an offence committed out of those Counties, could not be brought to trial at the same term.\n2d. That it is not necessary, nor is it material, to furnish the prisoner with a copy of the caption, as well as of the indictment.\nThe act of Congress must be presumed to have been passed with a full knowledge of the State law ; and by the State law, evinced and supported by a constant practice, nothing more than a copy of the indictment was required, 1 Dall. Rep. 33. Sufficient appears on the indictment to shew, what it is incumbent on the prosecutor to shew. The case referred to in Fost. p.229, was that of a special Court, where a caption is undoubtedly necessary; and the distinction is expressly so taken. Fost. 11. Hawk. c. 25. s. 126.\n*\n3d. That the addition of the jurors and witnesses as to the place of abode, is sufficient; but if the Court think otherwise, time will be allowed to amend it. The act of Congress, however, does not require a specification of the occupation of the jurors and witnesses, but only of their names and places of abode; and it cannot be controuled by the provision of the State act; which is in that respect different ; but must be deemed substantive. and independent.\nOn the 18th of May the Judges of the Court delivered their opinions to the following effect.\n* Patterson, Justice. The cases of Special Court , or of inferior Courts held by charter, &c. can furnish no analogy for this Court, which is a Court of original and permanent jurisdiction. The proceedings in the King's Beach can alone be applicable."}}}, {"id": 11747290, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11747290/", "name": "The United States versus Stewart; The Same versus Wright", "name_abbreviation": "United States v.

The act directs notice to be given ; this must be intended for the purpose alluded to, and, for the attainment of that purpose, time is, undoubtedly, necessary.\nIt must, therefore, be considered as a rule in this case, and in all other cases of a similar nature, that a reasonable time shall be allowed, after a list of the names of the witnesses is furnished to the prisoners, for the purpose of bringing testimony from thcounties in which those witnesses live.\nThe trials of Stewart & Wright were, accordingly, postponed; and it was then agreed that they should not be brought on \u2019till the trial of the other prisoners, who were ready for trial, was concluded; but so much time was consumed in this previous business, that the judges declared they could not longer protract the sitting of the Court, on account of other Circuits, and, therefore directed the cases of Stewart & Wright to be continued generally \u2019till the next term. It appeared, however, that on the preceding day, Lewis had informed the Attorney for the District, that he would proceed to trial in the case of Stewart, with the testimony already in his possession, though he expedited other witnesses; and, on this ground, as the Court was about to break Up, he moved, that Stewart should be admitted to bail.\nBut, by the Court :\u2014It was Stewart's own fault, not the fault of the prosecutor, that the trial was postponed.

The Same versus Wright.\nRawle (Attorney for the District)\nTHE Prisoners being brought to the bar, on separate charges of High Treason, Lewis read their depositions, stating the absence of material witnesses in both cases, and moved to post-pone the trials \u2019till an opportunity was given, to procure the attendance of those witnesses from the Western Counties. He urged, the general inconveniency of a commitment and trial at so great a distance, from the scene of the criminal transaction ; the friendless situation of the prisoners, and the poverty of the witnesses; and he alledged, that, under such circumstances, an immediate trial would be a mere ex parte proceeding. To shew the lenity with which persons thus charged have always been treated, he cited Fost. C.L.1, and to account for the delay in procuring the witnesses, be observed, that as the act of Congress (1 Vol. p. 67 s. 29) declared, that in cases punishable with death, the trial shall be had in the County where the offence was committed,\u201d if it could be done without great inconvenience, the prisoners might reasonably have expected that indulgence, until the motion for a Special Court had been refused, on account of the peculiar difficulties of the case, in opposition to the general inclination of the Judges. Nor could there be any preparation for trial \u2019till the charge was known, and the names of the witnesses who were to prove the indictments. By the practice under the Constitution and laws of Pennsylvania (and the case is the same here) a defendant cannot have compulsory process to bring in his witnesses, before he has sworn that they are material; and he cannot so swear \u2019till he knows the charge and the witnesses that support it. It is essential to the administration of justice, and to the feelings of humanity, that the defendants should have time to investigate the characters of witnesses, and to bring proofs in contradiction to the accusation. Hence, even in England, where the Counties are generally smaller than in this country, a period of ten days is allowed, between the time of furnishing lifts of the witnesses and jurors, and the time of trial: 7 Ann. c. 21. 4 Bl. Com. 345. and altho\u2019 the act of Congress (1 Vol. p. 112. s. 29) only says that copies of the indictment and a list of the jury and witnesses shall be delivered to the prisoner \u201c at least, three entire days before he shall be tried,\u201d yet it must certainly be the intention of the Legislature to afford an opportunity to canvass the characters of the witnesses, or the provision would be nugatory:. that opportunity cannot be deemed to commence \u2019till he knows their names, and it cannot be deemed to be compleat, unless he has had time, to send for information to the places in which they reside. The Court will, therefore, exercise a discretion as to the length of time to be allowed, in proportion to the distance ; and, conformably to the case in Fost. 1, the time to allowed for preparation, will be subsequent to the delivery of the copy of the indictment, and the lists of witnesses.\npremised, that an acquiescence in the present motion, would, probably, put off the trial for the term. He urged, that the prisoners must long ago have known the nature of the charge, and the proofs necessary to their defence ; and ought to have made an earlier application for the aid of the Court to procure their witnesses. Due diligence has not been used, nor, indeed, is it so stated in the affidavits ; and it is not only necessary to satisfy the Court that the witnesses are material; but also that the party applying has been guilty of no laches, or neglect, in omitting to apply to them and endeavouring to procure their attendance. 3 Burr. 1513. Ever since the 20th April, there has been an opportunity to make this motion ; which was not the case in Fost. 1, as that arose before a Special Court, acting under a special commission, for special purposes. Nor can there be a just reason to object to the trial\u2019s coming on, because of die place at which the Court is held. On the motion for a Special Court, sufficient was disclosed to shew, that the indictments would be presented in Philadelphia ; and it was a mere speculation afterwards to suppose that another place would be appointed for the trials ; particularly as all the jurors and witnesses had been actually summoned."}}}, {"id": 11747354, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11747354/", "name": "The United States versus Porter", "name_abbreviation": "United States v.

But in this they have failed ; for the whole scene exhibits a disgraceful unanimity ; and, with regard to the prisoner, he can only be distinguished for a guilty pre-eminence in zeal and activity. It may not, however, be useless on this occasion, to observe, that the fear, which the law recognizes as an excuse for the perpetration of an offence, must proceed from an immediate and actual danger, threatening the very life of the party. The apprehension of any lots of property, by waste, or fire; or even an apprehension of a flight or remote injury to the person, furnish no excuse. If, indeed, such circumstances could avail, it would be in the power of every crafty leader of tumults and rebellion, to indemnify his followers, by uttering previous menaces ; an avenue would be forever open for the escape of unsuccessful guilt; and the whole fabric of society must, inevitably, be laid prostrate.\nA technical objection has, also, been suggested in favor of the prisoner. It is said, that the offence is not proved to have been committed, on the day, nor the number of the Insurgent party to be so great, as the indictment states.

With what view was the attack made on General Neville\u2019s house ? Was it to gratify a spirit of revenge against him as a private citizen, as an individual ? No :\u2014as a private citizen he had been highly respected and beloved ; it was only by becoming a public officer, that he became obnoxious; and it was on account of his holding the excise office alone, that his house had been assailed, and his person endangered. On the first day of attack, the insurgents were repulsed; but they rallied, returned with greater force, and fatally succeeded in the second attempt. They were arrayed in a military manner; they affected the military forms of negociation by a flag ; they pretended no personal hostility to General Neville ; but they insisted on the surrender of his commission. Can there be a doubt, then, that the object of the insurrection was of a general and public nature ?\nThe second question to be considered, is\u2014how far was the prisoner traiterously connected with the insurgents ? It is proved by four witnesses, that he was at Couche\u2019s Fort, at a great distance from his own home, and that he was armed. One witness proves, positively, that he was at the burning of Get. Neville's house ; and another says, \u201c it runs in his head, that he, also, saw the prisoner there.\u201d On this state of the facts, a difficulty has been suggested. It is said, that no act of Treason was committed at Couche\u2019s Fort ; and that, however treasonable the proceedings at Gen. Neville\u2019s may have been, there are not two witnesses, who prove that the prisoner was there. Of the overt-a Treason, there must, undoubtedly, be proof by two witnesses ; and, it is equally clear, that the intention and the act, the will and the deed, must concur ; for, a bare conspiracy is not Treason. But let us consider the prisoner\u2019s conduct in a regular and connected course. He is proved, by a competent number of witnesses, to have been at Couche's Fort. At Couche\u2019s Fort the conspiracy was formed, for attacking Gen. Neville\u2019s house ; and the prisoner was actually passed on the march thither. Now, in Foster 213. the very act of marching is considered as carrying the traiterous intention into effect; and the Jury (who will sometimes find the most positive testimony, contradicted by circumstances, which carry irresistable conviction to the mind) will consider how far this aids the doubtful language of the second witness, even as to the fact of the prisoner\u2019s being at Gen. Neville\u2019s house.\nOn the personal motives and conduct of the prisoner, it would be superfluous to make a particular commentary. He was armed, he was a volunteer, he was a party to the various consultations of the insurgents; and in every scene of the insurrection, from the assembly at Couche's Fort to the day prescribed for submission to the government, he makes a conspicuous appearance. His attendance, armed, at Bradock\u2019s field, would of itself amount to Treason, if his, design was treasonable.\nUpon the whole, whether the conspiracy at Couche's Fort may of itself be deemed Treason ; or, the conspiracy there, and the proceedings at Gen. Neville's house, are considered as one act, (which is, perhaps, the true light to view the subject in) the prisoner must be pronounced guilty. The consequences are not to weigh with the Jury :\u2014it is their province to do justice ; the attribute of mercy is placed by our Constitution in other hands.\nVerdict\u2014Guilty.\n*\n* The prisoner was pardoned ; and the President afterwards granted a general amnesty to all the insurgents, who were not objects of depending prosecutions.", "author": "Patterson, Justice.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "The United States versus Mitchell.\nINDICTMENT for High Treason, by levying war against the United States. It was alledged, that the prisoner was one of the party that assembled at Couche's Fort, armed; that he proceeded thence to Gen. Neville's, and assisted at the burning of the general\u2019s house ; that he attended with great zeal at the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field ; and that on the day prescribed for signing a submission to the government he was intoxicated, refused to sign himself, and was active in dissuading others from signing. The circumstance of the prisoner\u2019s being at Couche's was proved by a number of witnesses; his being at Bradock\u2019s field, by one witness and his own confession ; but there was only one positive witness to the fact of his having been at the burning of general Neville's house, tho\u2019 a second witness said it ran in his head that he had seen him there,\u201d and a third declared that he had passed him on the march thither. The scope of the testimony as it respected the general object of the insurrection, and as it particularly applied to the prisoner, will be found sufficiently stated in the course of the arguments and charge.\n-The Attorney of the Diftrift (Ra\u00edaleJ having clofed the evidence, proceeded to ftate the law, in fupport of the profecuticn. So frequently and fully has the offence of levying war againft the government been defined, that a doubt can hardly be raifed \u2022upon the fubjeft. Kings, it is true, have endeavoured to augment the number, and to perplex the deferiptions, of treafons, as \u00e1n inftrument to enlarge their powers, and to opprpfs their fubjedts ; but in Republics, and, particularly, in the American Republic, the crime \u00aef treafon is naturally reduced to a fingle head, which divides itfelf into thefe Conftitutional propofitions :. ift. Levying war againft the government, and 2dly. Adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort:\u2014In other words, exciting internal, or waging external,, war, againft the State. The fecond branch of the crime, thus defignated, renders it unlawful and treafonable for any citizen to adhere to a foreign, public, enemy, whether affailing. the frontiers, or penetrating into the heart, of our country. But while fuch ', co-operation endangers the fucccfs and profperity of the community, the effects of domestic insurrection, (which the first branch of the division contemplates) strike at the root of its existence; and, in free countries above all, must be prevented, or corrected, by the most vigilant and efficient fanctions of the law.\nWhat constitutes a levying of war, however, must be the same, in technical interpretation, whether committed under a republican, or a regal, form of government; since either institution may be assailed and subverted by the same means. Hence we are enabled, in the first stage of our own experience, to acquire precise and satisfactory ideas upon the subject, from the matured experience of another government, which has employed the same language to describe the offence, and is guided by the same rules of judicial exposition. By the English authorities, it is uniformly and clearly declared, that raising a body of men to obtain, by intimidation or violence, the repeal of a law, or to oppose and prevent by force and terror, the execution of a law is an act of levying war. Doug. 570. Again ;\u2014an insurrection with an avowed design to suppress public offices, is an act of levying war: And, although a bare conspiracy to levy war, may not amount to that species of treason ; yet, if any of the conspirators actually levy war, it is treason in all the persons that conspired ; and in Fost. 218, it is even laid down, that an assembly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for a treasonable purpose is Bellum levatum, though not Bellum percussum. Those, likewise who join afterwards, though not concerned at first in the plot, are as guilty as the original conspirators; for in Treason all are principals ; and whenever a lawless meeting is convened, whether it shall be treated as riot, or treason, will depend on the quo animo. 4 BL.

Keil. 19. 3 Inst. 9.\nThe evidence, unfortunately, leaves no room for excuse, or extenuation, in the application of the law to the prisoner's case. The general and avowed object of the conspiracy at Couche's Fort, was to suppress the offices of excise in the Fourth Survey. As an important measure for that purpose, it was agreed to go to General Neville's house, and to compel him to surrender his office, and his official papers. Some of the persons who were at Couche's Fort, went accordingly, to General Neville's, and terminated a course of lawless and outrageous proceedings by burning his house. The prisoner is proved by four witnesses to have been at Couche's Fort ; and so far from opposing the expedition to General Neville's he offered himself to reconnoitre. Being thus originally combined with the conspirators in a treasonable purpose, to levy war, it was unnecessary that the purpose should be afterwards executed, in order to convict them all of treason, and much less is it necessary to his conviction, that he should have been present at the burning of General Neville's house, which was the consummation of their plot, or that the burning should be proved by two witnesses. But he is, likewise discovered, by one of the witnesses at least, within a few rods of the General\u2019s, at the moment of the conflagration and he is seen marching in the cavalcade, which escorted the dead body of their leader, in melancholy triumph, from the scene of action to Barclay's house. It is not necessary to confident the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field as an independent treason, though the avowed intention was to attack the garrison at Pittsburgh, and to expel certain public officers from the town; but the conduct of the prisoner on that occasion, concurring in every violent proposition that was made ; and his refractory and seditious deportment on the day prescribed for signing the declaration of submission to the laws ; are corroborative demonstrations of that mala mens, that dark and dreary turbulence of foul, which is regardless of every social, moral, and religious obligation.\n*\nThe Counsel for the prisoner (E. Tilghman & Thomas) premised, that they did not conceive it to be their duty to shew, that the prisoner was guiltless of any description of crime against the United States, or the State of Pennsylvania ; but they contended, that he had not committed the crime of High Treason ; and ought, therefore, to be acquitted upon the present indictment. The adjudications in England upon the various descriptions of treason, have been worked, incautiously, into a system, by the destruction of which, at this day, the government itself would be seriously affected : but even there, the best judges and the ablest commentators, while they acquiesce in the decisions that have already taken place, furnish a strong caution against the too easy admission of future cases, which may seem to have a parity of reason. Constructive, or interpretative treasons, must be the dread and scourge of any nation that allows them. 1 Hal. P.C. 132. 259. 4 Bl. Com. 85. Take, then, the distinction of treason by levying, war, as laid down by the Attorney of the District, add it is a constructive, or interpretative, weapon, which is calculated to annul all distinctions heretofore wisely established in the grades and punishments of crimes ; and by whose magic power a mob may easily be converted into a conspiracy ; and a riot aggravated into High Treason. Such, however, is not the sense which Congress has expressed upon this very subject ; for, if a bare opposition to the execution of a law can be considered as constituting a traiterous offence, as levying war against the government, it must be equally to, in relation to every other law, as well as in relation to the excise law ; and in relation to the Marshall of a Court, as much as in relation to the Supervisor of a District : And yet, in the Penal Code of the United States, the offence of wilfully obstructing, resisting, or opposing, any officer, in serving, or attempting to serve any process, is considered and punished merely as a misdemeanor. (1 Vol. Swift\u2019s Edit. p. 109. s. 22.) Let it be granted, that to compel Congress to repeal a law, by violence, or intimidation, is treason (and the English authorities rightly confirmed, claim no greater concession) it does not follow, that resisting the execution of a law, or attempting to coerce an officer into the resignation of his commission, will amount to the same, offence. Let it be granted, also, that an insurrection, for the avowed purpose of suppressing all the excise offices in the United States, may be confirmed into an act of levying war against the government (and the English authorities speak expressly of the universality of the object, as an essential characteristic of this species of treason) it does not follow that an attempt to oblige one officer to resign or to suppress all the offices in one district, will be a crime of the same denomination, 1 Hal. P. C. 135. Nor can another doctrine, urged in support of the prosecution, be fairly recognized. It is laid down in all the books, which have been cited, it is admitted by the attorney general, that a bare conspiracy to levy war, does not amount to treason ; but, it is contended, that if, at any time afterwards, a part of the conspirators should execute the plot, the whole of them, will be involved in the guilt and punishment. Thus, no opportunity is left for repentance ; the motives which restrain the absentees from attending at the scene of action, however pure, can furnish no excuse ;\u2014and they are doomed to answer for the conduct of others, which they may, in fact, disapprove, and which they cannot, in any degree, controul. The state of the evidence, however, renders it unavoidable, that this ground should be taken ; for, unless the proceedings at Couche\u2019s Fort and at Gen. Neville's house can be to combined and interwoven as to form one action, there are not two witnesses to prove that the prisoner was at the latter place; and the conduct at the former, could only amount, under the most rigid construction, to a conspiracy to levy war, not to an actual levying of war against the government. With the necessity for two witnesses to an overt act of treason, it is not in the power of Judges or Juries to, dispense ;\u2014it is a shield from oppression with which the Constitution furnishes the prisoner; and it cannot be supplied by vague conjectures, founded on the feeble recollection of a witness; nor by idle declarations of the party himself, in a state of intoxication; a state that does not justify the perpetration of a crime, but may fairly be supposed to deprive the criminal of a knowledge of the extent of his confession. 2 Hawk. 604. in not. Fost. C. L. 240. 4 Bl. C. 356. 1 Dall. Rep. 39. 40.\nIf this view of the law is correct, it will be easy to shew, that its operation upon the facts, will entitle the prisoner to an acquittal. By the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field no act of treason was committed ; nor was any plan for levying war contrived. The people assembled there upon a general invitation, founded on the calamitous state of the country ; and, though they proposed banishing certain citizens (who were not public officers of the United States) from Pittsburgh (which cannot surely be deemed treason) they neither executed that project, nor committed any other outrage ; but after some menaces and an idle parade, dispersed to their respective homes. The prisoner was certainly at Bradock\u2019s field; but no treason being committed there, his attendance is not a foundation for the present indictment. It may be admitted, likewise, that at Bradock's field, he made some vaunting declarations of a traiterous intention ; but a traiterous intention there, is no proof of his having levied war against the government at another time, and in another place. With respect to the criminal proceedings at Gen. Neville\u2019s house (which after all amount to the crime of arson, and not of treason) it is agreed that only one positive witness proves the fact of the prisoner\u2019s having been there ; but even that witness states, that the Prisoner was alone, at the distance of 30 or 40 rods ; and it is not recollected whether he had a gun. Then it only remains to consider the effect of the prisoner\u2019s presence at Couche\u2019s Fort ; for, his being seen in a cavalcade on the road for Gen. Neville's, and his conduct on the day prescribed for signing the submission to government, when he was notoriously drunk, may prove him to be a very bad man, but will not be sufficient to maintain a charge of High Treason. It does not, then, appear by the testimony of two witnesses, that the meeting at Couche's Fort was convened for the purpose of accomplishing a compulsory repeal of the excise laws, or a suppression of the excise offices. The meeting seems to have originated merely in a wish to consider what it was best to do in the actual state of the country. On that point a committee was chosen, or rather was self-created ; and the members determined to send a flag to Gen.Neville. It does not appear with what view the flag was to be sent; but it will not be presumed, when the evidence is silent, to be with a view to attack the General\u2019s house, to force a repeal of the excise law, or to compel the officer\u2019s resignation ; and even the fact itself is only proved by one witness. Besides, the conduct of the committee, however culpable, will not be sufficient to involve the whole assembly in the guilt of Treason. It is true, that the prisoner expressed his willingness to reconnoitre Gen. Neville's house ; but this expression, likewise, is only proved by one witness ; and even if it were proved by fifty witnesses, it does not amount to an overt act of Treason by levying war; nor does it appear that he ever did reconnoitre, or furnish intelligence to the committee. The proof against Porter (ant. p. 345) was as strong, and yet he was acquitted. Upon the whole, if the proceedings at Couche\u2019s Fort and Gen. Neville\u2019s house, must be considered as one action, that action must take its colour, quality, and character, from what was done at the latter place ; and as there are not two witnesses to the overt act committed there, it is immaterial what was the conduct of the prisoner at Couche\u2019s Fort. The perpetration is the gift of the crime ; and he only is to be adjudged guilty, who joined in the actual perpetration.\nThe Attorney General of the United States (Bradford) in reply. It is essential to the security of life, liberty, and property, that the powers of government should exist under some modification; and under whatever modification they exist, an attempt to defeat or destroy them, must be Treason. If, however, the principles asserted in the course of the prisoner\u2019s defence should prevail, a flagrant attempt to obstruct the legitimate operations of the government, to prevent the execution of its laws, and to coerce its officers into a dereliction of their trust, must no longer be regarded as High Treason; every man engaged in the administration of the public affairs has erred in considering the insurrection as any thing more than a common, contemptible, riot ; Vigol, who has been convicted, ought to have been acquitted ; and all the prisoners committed upon the same charge, ought instantly to be released ! But this doctrine and its consequences will not be found compatible with our Constitution ; and cannot receive the countenance of a Court of Justice.\nTo proceed, however, in a more minute analysis of the defence; it has been argued, that Congress has provided a specific punishment, for the offence of resisting or obstructing the service of process, obviously distinguishing it from Treason ; and that it is as much Treason to resist the execution of one law as another ; to resist the Marshall of a Court, as much as the Supervisor of a District. The analogy is, in a great measure, just: In either case, if the resistance is made by a few persons, in a particular instance, and under the impulse of a particular interest, the offence would not amount to High Treason ; but, if, in either case, there is a general rising of a whole County, to prevent the officer from discharging his duty in relation to the public at large, the offence is, unquestionably, High Treason. Thus an opposition was lately made to the appointment of a particular Judge in Mifflin County, and he was, forcibly, driven from the Bench ; but the offence was prosecuted merely as a riot, upon this principle of discrimination, that the design was not to prevent the Governor from appointing any Judge, but only to displace an unpopular individual.\nAgain, it has been urged, that the criminal intention must point to the suppression of all the excise offices in the United States, or it cannot amount to High Treason. If it is meant by this argument, that the insurgents of Pennsylvania must have contemplated a march from Georgia to New Hampshire, it is extravagant and absurd : but, in another view, it is perfectly correct ; for, if it was intended that, by their lawless carreer and example, Congress should be forced into a repeal of the obnoxious law, it necessarily followed, that, from the same cause, the offices of excise would be suppressed throughout the Union. That universality of object, which the books require, was inseparable from the nature of the opposition ; for, it was impossible to contemplate the repeal of the excise law in one Survey, or in one State, without effecting it in every Survey, and in every State.\nThe truth is, however, that the insurgents did not entertain a personal dislike for Gen. Neville; but in every stage of their proceedings, at Couche's Fort, at the General\u2019s house, and at Bradock\u2019s field, they were actuated by one single, traiterous, motive, a determination, if practicable, to frustrate and prevent the execution of the excise law. The whole was one great insurrection ; and it is immaterial at what point of time, or place, from its commencement to its termination, any man became an agent in carrying it on. Many persons, indeed, may have attended innocently at Couche\u2019s Fort (as was the case with Porter) but those would not remain long, after the purpose of the meeting was developed. To render any man criminal, he must not only have been present, but he must have taken part with the insurgents ; yet, whether he was present at Couche\u2019s Fort, on the march to Gen. Neville\u2019s, or at the burning of the General\u2019s house, if his intention was traiterous, his offence was treason. 3 Inst. 9. The overt act laid in the indictment (which is drawn from the most approved precedents) is levying war; and war may be levied, though not actually made. Fost. 218. It is agreed that this overt act must be proved by two witnesses; but there is a difference as to what constitutes. the act itself. Now, it is manifest from every authority, that to assemble in a body, armed, and arrayed, for some treasonable purpose, is an act of levying war; this was the case at Couche\u2019s Fort; and the prisoner's active attendance there is proved by a number of witnesses. It is not required that every witness should have seen him at the same spot, at the same moment, and in the same act ; but if they see him at the place and time of rendezvous, exhibiting the same species of traiterous conduct, the law is satisfied. The conspiracy to levy war being effected, all the conspirators are guilty, though they did not all attend at Gen Neville\u2019s house. 1 Hal. P. C. 132. Fost. 213. 215. Besides, the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field is a distinct and substantive act of Treason; and the prisoner is proved by four witnesses to have been there. The design of the meeting, was, avowedly, to oppose the execution of the excise law, to over awe the government, to involve others in the guilt of the insurrection, to prevent the punishment of the delinquents, to banish unpopular individuals from the town, and to attack the garrison of Pittsburg. The hasty declarations of the quo animo, proceeding from the prisoner himself, ought not to have much weight, were they not so strongly corroborated by other testimony.\n* Patterson, Justice. Before the defence is opened, I wish to direct the attention of the prisoner\u2019s counsel to two considerations : 1st. Whether the conspiracy to levy war at Couche\u2019s Fort, was rot, in legal contemplation, an actual levying of war? 2d. Whether the proceedings at General Neville's house were not a continuation of the set, which originated at Couche's Fort ? For, several witnesses have proved that the prisoner was at Couche's Fort, and one positive witness has proved, that he was at Gen. Neville\u2019s house."}}}, {"id": 11747592, "url": "https://api.case.law/v1/cases/11747592/", "name": "The Same Cause", "name_abbreviation": "Same Cause", "decision_date": "1795", "docket_number": "", "first_page": "357", "last_page": "357", "citations": [{"type": "official", "cite": "2 U.S. (Dall.) 357"}], "volume": {"url": "https://api.case.law/v1/volumes/32044049719099/", "volume_number": "2"}, "reporter": {"url": "https://api.case.law/v1/reporters/881/", "full_name": "United States Reports (Dallas)"}, "court": {"url": "https://api.case.law/v1/courts/ccd-pa/", "id": 9999, "slug": "ccd-pa", "name": "United States Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania", "name_abbreviation": "C.C.D.

The controversy always turned upon the construction of the 6th section of the \u201cAct for the government and regulation of seamen.\u201d 1 Laws U. S. p. 137 [1 Stat. 133]. I confess, that it has appeared to me unwarrantable, to contend that the ten days should run from the time of the discharge of the cargo. All laws should receive a construction according to justice, and the principles on which they are predicated. \u201cQui haeret in littera, haeret in cortice.\u201d The end of the voyage is clearly, in my opinion, the period when the wages, according to the contract, are due. The discharge of the cargo or ballast, is coupled with the end of the voyage in the law, not as part of the contract, or to fix the time, from whence the ten days are to be computed, but because it is a necessary step to enable the merchant to demand his freight; and the wages ought not to be paid, until this is recoverable, it being the fund, out of which the wages are payable. There cannot be two periods, from which one term of ten days must run. This would be absurd and impossible. It cannot be from the end of the voyage, \u201cand\u201d the discharge of the cargo, which must, of course, be after the end of the voyage. An obscurity in'terms is therefore involved, which fully justifies a discretionary interpretation. A reasonable time for the collection of freight should be given. The merchant should also have the opportunity afforded of examining the whole cargo, to see whether embezzlement, or damage chargeable on wages, has occurred. In most cases, ten days after the end of the voyage are sufficient to unlade and collect freight. But it sometimes happens, that where the cargo consists of a great variety of packages, or articles, belonging to a great number of owners, the custom house officers cannot grant permits, within that time. When a number of dry-good ships, added to others, cause a press of business at the custom house, I have perceived the impracticability of delivering the permits, in the time in which, on common occasions, they are issued. Under the latitude given in the words of the section, I have considered myself authorized to enquire into, and decide according to circumstances peculiar to the case. To allow an unreasonable time for discharge, would be as unjust, as it respects the mariner, as it would be- to compel the merchant, prematurely * to pay. Coals, salt, &c. are frequently retained on board, for a long time; and \u201cballast\u201d is not always discharged. On the contrary, it sometimes remains on board for more than one voyage. Exercising therefore a discretion, according to circumstances, I have given more or less time, as the evidence justified me. To fix on the time of discharge would be difficult, uncertain, and often unjust It depends on the industry, the inclination, or the interest of the owner, whether the discharge be accelerated, or unreasonably retarded. I have allowed, at the least, ten days from the end of the voyage; and at the most, fifteen working days to unlade. The latter period is given, in the collection law. for this purpose; after the time in which the master is bound to report Although it has been contended that ten days even after this period, should be allowed, I have not thought it just to extend the interpretation, to a length appearing so unreasonable. It is too great a hardship on seamen, and very injurious to commerce, to delay the payment of wages, and thereby reduce the mariner to distress, as well as prevent his employment in other service. Or, if he is forced by necessity to enter into other employment, it may be at the price of abandoning, or selling for a trifle, the earnings of a precedent voyage. The law was enacted to do justice, and not to impose unnecessary hardships by granting unreasonable indulgences. Although all the freight may not be collected within the ten or fifteen days, it can scarcely ever happen that a sufficient sum is not received, in that time, to discharge the demands of the crew.\nIn the case before me, 1 allow fifteen working days, from the end of the voyage: that is, from the day on which the vessel was made fast to the wharf, and ready to discharge.", "author": "COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "District Court, D.

If its object was to suppress the excise offices, and to prevent the execution of an act of congress, by force and intimidation, the offence, in legal estimation, is high treason; it is an usurpation of the authority of government; it is high treason by levying of war. Taking the testimony in a rational and connected point of view, this was the object: It was of a general nature, and of national concern.\nLet us attend, for a moment, to the evidence. With what view was the attack made on General Neville\u2019s house? Was it to gratify a spirit of revenge against him as a private citizen, as an individual? No:\u2014 as a private citizen he had been highly respected and beloved; it was only by becoming a public officer, that he became obnoxious; and it was on account of his holding the excise office alone, that his house had been assailed, and his person endangered. On the first day of attack, the \u2022 insurgents were repulsed; but they rallied, returned with greater force, and fatally succeeded in the second attempt They were arrayed in a military manner; they affected the military forms of negociation by a flag; they pretended no personal hostility to General Neville; but they insisted on the surrender of his commission. Can there be a doubt, than, that the object of the insurrection was of a general and public nature?\nThe second question to be considered, is\u2014 how far was the prisoner traiterously connected with the insurgents? It is proved by four witnesses, that he was at Couche\u2019s Fort, at a great distance from his own home, and that he was armed. One witness proves, positively, that he was at the burning of Gen. Neville's house; and another says, \u201cit runs in his head, that he, also, saw the prisoner there.\u201d On this state of the facts, a difficulty has been suggested. It is said, that no act of treason was committed at Couche\u2019s Fort; and that, however treasonable the. proceedings at Gen. Neville\u2019s may \u25a0 have been, there are not two witnesses, who prove that the prisoner was there. Of the overt act of treason, there must, undoubtedly, be proof by two witnesses; and, it is equally clear, that the intention and the act, the will and the deed, must concur; for, a bare conspiracy is not treason. But let us consider the prisoner\u2019s conduct in a regular and connected course. He is proved, by a competent number of witnesses, to have been at Couche\u2019s Fort. At Couche\u2019s Fort the conspiracy was formed, for attacking Gen. Ne-ville\u2019s house; and the prisoner was actually passed on the march thither. Now, in Fost. Crown Law, 218, the very act of marching is considered as carrying the traiterous intention into effect; and the jury (who will sometimes find the most positive testimony, contradicted by circumstances, which carry irresistible conviction to the mind) will consider how far this aids the doubtful language of the second witness, even as to the fact of the prisoner\u2019s being at Gen. Neville\u2019s house.\nOn the personal motives and conduct of the prisoner, it would be superfluous to make a particular commentary. He was armed, he was a volunteer, he was a party to the various consultations of the insurgents; and in every scene of the insurrection, from the assembly at Couche\u2019s Fort to the day prescribed for submission to the government, he makes a conspicuous appearance. His attendance, armed, at Bradock\u2019s field, would of itself amount to treason, if his design was treasonable.\nUpon the whole, whether the conspiracy at Couche\u2019s Fort may of itself be deemed treason; or, the conspiracy there, and the proceedings at Gen. Neville\u2019s house, are considered as one act, (which is, perhaps, the true light to view the subject in) the prisoner must be pronounced guilty. The consequences are not to weigh with the jury:\u2014it is their province to do justice; the attribute of mercy is placed by our constitution in other hands.\nVerdict\u2014Guilty.\nThe prisoner was pardoned: and the president afterwards granted a general amnestv to all the insurgents, who were not objects of depending prosecutions.", "author": "PATERSON, Circuit Justice", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": [], "head_matter": "Circuit Court. D. Pennsylvania.\n[2 Dall. 348;\nUNITED STATES v. MITCHELL.\n1\n1795.\nIndictment for high treason, by levying war against the United States. It was alleged, that the prisoner was one of the party that assembled at Couche\u2019s Fort, armed; that he proceeded thence to Gen. Neville\u2019s, and assisted at the burning of the general\u2019s house; that he attended with great zeal at the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field; and that on the day prescribed for signing a submission to the government he was intoxicated, refused to sign himself, and was active in dissuading others from signing. The circumstance of the prisoner\u2019s being at Couche\u2019s was proved by a number of witnesses; his being at Bradock\u2019s field, by one witness and his own confession; but there was only one positive witness to the fact of his having been at the burning of General Neville\u2019s house though a second witness said \u201cit ran in his head that he had seen him there,\u201d and a third declared that he had passed him on the march thither. The scope of the testimony as it respected the general object of the insurrection, and as it particularly applied to the prisoner, will be found sufficiently stated in the course of the arguments and charge.\nThe attorney of the district (Rawle) having closed the evidence, proceeded to state the law, in support of the prosecution. So frequently and fully has the offence of levying war against the government been defined, that a doubt can hardly be raised upon the subject. Kings, it is true, have endeavoured to augment the number, and to perplex the descriptions, of treasons, as an instrument to enlarge their powers, and to oppress their subjects; but in republics, and, particularly, in the American republic, the crime of treason is naturally reduced to a single head, which divides itself into these constitutional propositions: 1st, levying war against the government; and, 2dlv, adhering to its enemies, giving them aid and comfort:\u2014In other words, exciting internal, or waging external, war, against the state. The second branch of the crime, thus designated, renders it unlawful and treasonable for any citizen to adhere to a foreign, public enemy, whether assailing the frontiers, or penetrating into the heart, of our country. But while such a co-operation endangers the success and prosperity of the community, the effects of domestic insurrection (which the first branch of the division contemplates) strike at the root of its existence; and, in free countries above all, must be prevented, or corrected, by the most vigilant and efficient sanctions of the law. What constitutes a levying of war, however, must be the same, in technic\u00e1l interpretation, whether committed under a republican, or a regal, form of government; since either institution may be assailed and subverted by the same means. Hence we are enabled, in the first stage of our own experience, to acquire precise satisfactory ideas upon the subject, from the matured experience of another government, which has employed the same language to describe the offence, and is guided by the same rules of judicial exposition. By the English authorities, it is uniformly and clearly declared, that raising a body of men to obtain, by intimidation or violence, the repeal of a law, or to oppose and prevent by force and terror, the execution of a law, is an act of levying war. Doug. 570. Again;\u2014an insurrection with an avowed design to suppress public offices, is an act of levying war: And, although a bare conspiracy to levy war, may not amount to that species of treason; yet, if any of the conspirators actually levy war, it is treason in all the persons that conspired; and in Fost. Crown Law, 21S, it is even laid down, that an assembly armed and arrayed in a warlike manner for a treasonable purpose is bellum levatum, though not helium percussum. Those, likewise, who join afterwards, though not concerned at first in the plot, are as guilty as the original conspirators; for in treason all are principals; and whenever a lawless meeting is convened, whether it shall be treated as riot, or treason, will depend on the quo animo. 4 Bl. Comm. 81; 1 Hale, P. C. 133, 134; Fost. Crown Law, 213, 210, 215, 218; 1 Hawk. P. C. 37; 4 Bl. Comm. 35; 1 Hale, P. C. 440; 8 State Tr. 247; 2 State Tr. 58(5; 7 Keilw. 10; 3 Inst. 9.\nThe evidence, unfortunately, leaves no room for excuse, or extenuation, in the application of the law to the prisoner\u2019s case. The general and avowed object of the conspiracy at Couche\u2019s Fort, was to suppress the offices of excise in the Fourth survey. As an important measure for that purpose, it was agreed to go to General Neville\u2019s house, and to compel him to surrender his office, and his official papers. Some of the persons who were at. Couche\u2019s Fort, went, accordingly, to General Neville\u2019s, and terminated a course of lawless and outrageous proceedings by burning his house. The prisoner is proved by four witnesses to have been at Couche\u2019s Fort; and so far from opposing the expedition to General Neville\u2019s, he offered himself to reconnoitre. Being thus originally combined with the conspirators, in a treasonable purpose, to levy war. it was unnecessary that the purpose should be after-wards executed, in order to convict them all of treason, and much less is it necessary to his conviction, that he should have been present at the burning of General Neville\u2019s house, which was the consummation of their plot, or that the burning should be proved by two witnesses. But he is, likewise, discovered, by one of the witnesses at least, within a few rods of the general\u2019s, at the moment of the conflagration; and he is seen marching in the cavalcade, which escorted the dead body of their leader, in melancholy triumph, from the scene of action to Barclay\u2019s house. It is not necessary to consider the meeting at Brad-ock\u2019s field as an independent treason, though the avowed intention was to attack the garrison at Pittsburgh, and to expel certain pub-lie officers .from the town; but the conduct of the prisoner on that occasion, concurring in every violent proposition that was made; and his refractory and seditious deportment on the day prescribed for signing the declaration of submission to the laws; are corroborative demonstrations of that mala mens, that dark and dreary turbulence of soul, which is regardless of every social, moral, and religious obligation.\nPATERSON, Circuit Justice. Before the defence is opened, I wish to direct the attention of the prisoner\u2019s counsel to two considerations: 1st. Whether the conspiracy to levy war at Couche\u2019s Fort, was not, in legal contemplation, an actual levying of war? 2d. Whether the proceedings at General Neville\u2019s house were not a continuation of the act, which originated at Couehe\u2019s Fort? For, several witnesses have proved that the prisoner was at Couche\u2019s Fort, and one positive witness has proved, that he was at Gen. Ne-ville\u2019s house.\nThe counsel for the prisoner (E. Tilghman & Thomas) premised, that they did not conceive it to be their duty to shew, that the prisoner was guiltless of any description of crime against the United States, or the state of Pennsylvania; but they contended, that he had not committed the crime of high treason; and ought, therefore, to be acquitted upon the present indictment. The adjudications in England upon the various descriptions of treason, have been worked, incautiously, into a system, by the destruction of which, at this day, the government itself would be seriously affected: but even there, the best judges and the ablest commentators, while they acquiesce in the decisions that have already taken place, furnish a strong caution against the too easy admission of future cases, which may seem to have a parity of reason. Constructive, or interpretative treasons, must be the dread and scourge of any nation that allows them. 1 Hale, P. C. 132. 259; 4 Bl. Comm. S3. Take, then, the distinction of treason by levying war, as laid down by the attorney of the district, and it is a constructive or interpretative weapon, which is calculated to annul all distinctions heretofore wisely established in the grades and punishments of crimes; and by whose magic power a mob may easily be converted into a conspiracy; and a riot aggravated into high treason. Such, however, is not the sense which congress has expressed upon this very subject; for, if a bare opposition to the execution of a law can be considered as constituting a traiterous offence, as levying war against the government, it must be equally so, in relation to every other law, as well as in relation to the excise law; and in relation to the marshall pf a court, as much as in relation to the supervisor of a district: And yet, in the Penal Code of the United States, the offence of wilfully obstructing, resisting, or opposing, any officer, in serving, or attempting to serve any process, is considered and punished merely as a misdemeanor. 1 Swift\u2019s Ed. p. 109, \u00a7 22. Let it be granted, that to compel congress to repeal a law, by violence, or intimidation, is treason (and the English authorities rightly construed, claim no greater concession) it does not follow, that resisting the execution of a law, or attempting to coerce an officer into the resignation of his commission, will amount to the same offence. Let it be granted, also, that an insurrection, for the avowed purpose of suppressing all the excise offices in the United States, may be construed into an act of levying war against the government (and the English authorities speak expressly of the universality of the object, as an essential characteristic of this species of treason) it does not follow that an attempt to oblige one officer to resign, or to suppress all the offices in one district, will be a crime of the same denomination. 1 Hale, P. C. 135. Nor can another doctrine, urged in support of the prosecution, be fairly recognized. It is laid down in all the books, which have been cited, it is admitted by the attorney general, that a bare conspiracy to levy war, does not amount to treason; but, it is contended, that if, at any time afterwards, a part of the conspirators should execute the plot, the whole of them will be involved in the guilt and punishment. Thus, no opportunity is left for repentance; the motives which restrain the absentees from attending at the scene of action, however pure, can furnish no excuse;\u2014and they are doomed to answer for the conduct of others, which they may, in fact, disapprove, and which they cannot, in any degree, controul. The state of the evidence, however, renders it unavoidable, that this ground should be taken; for, unless the proceedings at Couche\u2019s Fort and at Gen. Neville\u2019s house can be so combined and interwoven as to form one action, there are not two witnesses to prove that the prisoner was at the latter place; and the conduct at the former, could only amount, under the most rigid construction, to a conspiracy to levy war, not to an actual levying of war against the government. With the. necessity for two witnesses to an overt act of treason, it is not in the power of judges or juries to dispense;\u2014it is a shield from oppression with which the constitution furnishes the prisoner; and it cannot be supplied by vague conjectures, founded on the feeble recollection of a witness; nor by idle declarations of the party himself, in a state of intoxication;' a state that does not justify the perpetration of a crime, but may fairly be supposed to deprive the criminal of a knowledge of the extent of his confession. 2 Hawk. P. C. 004, in note. Fost. Crown Law, 240; 4 Bl. Comm. 350; [Respublica v. Roberts] 1 Dali. [1 U. S.] 39, 40.\nIf this view of the law is correct, it will be easy to shew, that its operation upon the facts, will entitle the prisoner to an acquittal. By the meeting at Bradock\u2019s field no act of treason was committed; nor was any plan for levying war contrived. The people assembled there upon a general invitation, founded on the calamitous state of the country; and, though they proposed banishing certain citizens (.who were not public officers of the United States) from Pittsburgh (which cannot surely be deemed treason) they neither executed that project, nor committed any other outrage; but after some menaces and an idle parade, dispersed to their respective homes. The prisoner was certainly at Bradock's field; but no treason being committed there, his attendance is not a foundation for the present indictment. It may be admitted, likewise, that at Bradock\u2019s field, he made some vaunting declarations of a traiterous intention; but a traiterous intention there, is no proof of his having levied war against the government at another time, and in another place. With respect to the criminal proceedings at Gen. Neville\u2019s house (which after all amount to the crime of arson, and not of treason) it is agreed that only one positive witness proves the fact of the prisoner\u2019s having been there; but even that witness states, that the prisoner was alone, at the distance of 30 or 40 rods; and it is not recollected whether he had a gun. Then it only remains to consider the effect of the prisoner\u2019s presence at Gouche\u2019s Fort; for, his being seen in a cavalcade on the road for Gen. Neville\u2019s, and his conduct on the day prescribed for signing the submission to government, when he was notoriously drunk, may prove him to be a very bad man, but will not be sufficient to maintain a charge of high treason. It does not, then, appear by the testimony of two witnesses, that the meeting at Couche\u2019s Fort was convened for the purpose of accomplishing a compulsory repeal of the excise laws, or a suppression of the excise offices. The meeting seems to have originated merely in a wish to consider what it was best to do in the actual state of the country. On that point a conimittee was chosen, or rather was self created; and the members determined to send a flag to Gen. Neville. It does not appear with what view the flag was to be sent; but it will not be presumed, when the evidence is silent, to be with a view to attack the general's house, to force a repeal of the excise law, or to compel the officer\u2019s resignation; and even the fact itself is only proved by one witness. Besides, the conduct of the committee, however culpable, will not be sufficient to involve the whole assembly in the guilt of treason. It is true, that the prisoner expressed his willingness to reconnoitre Gen. Neville\u2019s house; but this expression, likewise, is only proved by one witness; and even if it were proved by fifty witnesses, it does not amount to an overt act of treason by levying war; nor does it appear that he ever did reconnoitre, or furnish intelligence to the committee. The proof against Porter [Case No. 10,073] was as strong, and yet he was acquitted. Upon the whole, if the proceedings at Couche\u2019s Fort and Gen. Neville\u2019s house, must be considered as one action, that action must take its colour, quality, and character, from what was done at the latter place; and as there are not two witneses to the overt act committed there, it is immaterial what was the conduct of the prisoner at Couche\u2019s Fort. The perpetration is the gist of the crime; and he only is to be adjudged guilty, who joined in the actual perpetration.\nThe attorney general of the United States (Bradford) in reply. It is essential to the security of life, liberty, and property, that the powers of government should exist under some modification; and under whatever modification they exist, an attempt to defeat or destroy them, must be treason. If, however, the principles asserted in the course of the prisoner\u2019s defence should prevail, a flagrant attempt to obstruct the legitimate operations of the government, to prevent the execution of its laws, and to coerce its officers into a dereliction of their trust, must no longer be regarded as high treason; every \u25a0man engaged in the administration of the public affairs has erred in considering the insurrection as any thing more than a common, contemptible riot; Yigol, who has been convicted, ought to have been acquitted; and all the prisoners committed upon the same charge, ought instantly to be released! But this doctrine and its consequences will not be found compatible with our constitution; and cannot receive the countenance of a court of justice.\nTo proceed, however, in a more minute analysis of the defence; it has been argued, that congress has provided a specific punishment, for the offence of resisting or obstructing tire service of process, obviously distinguishing it from treason; and that it is as much treason to resist the execution of one law as another; to resist the marshall of a court, as much as the supervisor of a district. The analogy is, in a great measure, just. In either case, if the resistance is made by a few persons, in a particular instance, and under the impulse of a particular interest, the offence would not amount to high treason; but, if, in either case, there is a general rising of a whole county, to prevent the officer from discharging his duty in relation to the public at large, the offence is, unquestionably, high treason. Thus an opposition was lately made to the appointment of a particular judge in Mifflin county, and he was forcibly driven from the bench; but the offence was prosecuted merely as a riot, upon this principle of discrimination, that the design was not to prevent the governor from appointing any. judge, but only to displace an unpopular individual.\nAgain, it has been urged, that.the criminal intention must point to the suppression of all the excise offices in the United States, or it cannot amount to high treason. If it is meant by this argument, that the insurgents of Pennsylvania must have contemplated a march from Georgia to New Hampshire, it is extravagant and absurd: but, in another view, it is perfectly correct; for, if it was intended that, by their lawless career and example, congress should be forced into a repeal of the obnoxious law, it necessarily followed, that, from the same cause, the offices of excise would be suppressed throughout the Union. That universality of object, which the books require, was inseparable from the nature of the opposition; for, it was impossible to contemplate the repeal of the excise law in one survey, or in one state, without effecting it in every survey, and in every state. The truth is, however, that the insurgents did not entertain a personal dislike for Gen. Neville; but in every stage of their proceedings, at Gouehe\u2019s Fort, at the general\u2019s house, and at Brad-ock\u2019s field, they were actuated by one single, traiterous, motive, a determination, if practicable, to frustrate and prevent the execution of the excise law. The whole was one great insurrection; and it is immaterial at what point of time, or place, from its commencement to its termination, any man became an agent in carrying it on. Many persons, indeed, may have attended innocently at Couche\u2019s Fort, as was the case with Porter; but those would not remain long, after the purpose of the meeting was developed. To render any man criminal, he must not only have been present, but he must have taken part with the insurgents; yet, whether he was present at Couche\u2019s Fort, on the march to Gen. Neville\u2019s, or at the burning of the general\u2019s house, if his intention was traiterous, his offence was treason. 3 Inst. 9. The overt act laid in the indictment (-which is drawn from the most approved precedents) is levying war; and war may be levied, though not actually made. Fost. Crown Law, 218. It is agreed that this overt act must be proved by two witnesses; but there is a difference as to what constitutes the act itself. Now, it is manifest from every authority, that to assemble in a body, armed and arrayed, for some treasonable purpose, is an act of levying war; this was the ease at Couche\u2019s Fort; and the prisoner\u2019s active attendance there is proved by a number of witnesses. It is not required that eveiy witness should have seen him at the same spot, at the same moment, and in the same act; but if they see him at the place and time of rendezvous, exhibiting the same species of traiterous conduct, the law is satisfied. The conspiracy to levy war being effected, all the conspirators are guilty, though, they did not all attend- at Gen. Neville\u2019s house. 1 Hale. P. C. 132; Fost. Crown Law. 213. 215. Besides, the meeting at Bradock's field is a distinct and substantive act of treason; and the prisoner - is proved by four witnesses to have been there. The design of the meeting, was, avowedly, to oppose the execution of the excise law, to over-awe the government, to involve others in the guilt of the insurrection, to prevent the punishment of the delinquents, to banish unpopular individuals from the town, and to attack the garrison of Pittsburgh. The hasty declarations of the quo animo, proceeding from the prisoner himself, ought not to have much weight, were they not to strongly corroborated by other testimony.\nCase No. 15,788.\nTreason against the United States\u2014Opposing the Execution op Laws\u2014Evidence of Overt Act.\n[1. A combination to suppress the excise officers of the government, and prevent the execution of an act of congress, accompanied by a display of force consisting of a number of men arrayed in a military manner, and with arms, and, by acts of violence, for the purpose of compelling an excise officer to resign his commission, is a levying war, and constitutes treason against the United States.]\n[2. Where it is shown by the evidence of several witnesses that the accused was present and took part in a treasonable conspiracy, it seems that proof by two or more witnesses that he marched as a volunteer with arms and in military array, with a party which actually used force to prevent the execution of an act of congress, is sufficient without proof by two witnesses that he was actually present when the acts of violence were committed.]\nWhart.

The attorney of the district offered testimony to prove, that, in the course of the insurrection, the prisoner joined in robbing the public mail of the United States; and that several of the letters thus intercepted, had been read at the meeting at Braddock\u2019s Field.\nBut it was objected, on behalf of the prisoner, that the robbery of the mail was a felony, for which, as a substantive and independent crime, he was actually charged by another indictment; and that, therefore, evidence relating to it should not be given on the present issue, as the prisoner was not prepared to answer, and a prejudice might be excited against him in the mind of the jury.\nBY THE COURT. An act committed with a felonious intention, cannot be given in evidence upon the trial of an indictment for high treason. It does not yet appear, that the mail was intercepted and rifled with a traitorous intention; and, as far as it respects the prisoner, there is another indict-meat against him, charging the offence merely as a felony.

The act directs notice to be given; this must be intended for the purpose alluded to, and, for the attainment of that purpose, time is, undoubtedly, necessary. It must, therefore, be considered as a rule in this case,- and in all other cases of a similar nature, that a reasonable time shall be allowed, after a list of the names of the witnesses is furnished to the prisoners, for the purpose of bringing testimony from the counties in which those witnesses live. The trials of Stewart & Wright were, accordingly, postponed; and it was then agreed that they should not be brought on \u2019till .the trial of the other prisoners, who were ready for trial, was concluded; but so much time was consumed in this previous business, that the judges declared they could not longer protract the sitting of the court, on account of other circuits, and, therefore directed the cases of Stewart & Wright to be continued generally \u2019till the next term. It appeared, however, that on the preceding day, Lewis had informed the attorney for the district, that he would proceed to trial in the case of Stewart, with the testimony already in his possession, though he expected other witnesses; and, on this ground, as the court was about to break up, he moved, that Stewart should be admitted to bail.\nBut, BY THE COURT, it was Stewart\u2019s own fault, not the fault of the prosecutor, that the trial was postponed. He has now the same witnesses, that he had at the time of the postponement; but the judges cannot, consistently with their other duties, enter on the trial. It is true, that we have established it as a principle, that no laches should be imputed to the prisoner, for taking time to send into the counties where the witnesses for the prosecution reside, after he had received notice of their names; but that is not the case at present. Stewart has no claim upon the legal discretion of the court; and, indeed, the circumstances must be very strong, which will, at any time, induce us to admit a person to bail, who stands charged with high treason.", "author": "BY THE COURT.", "type": "majority"}], "attorneys": ["Rawle (attorney for the district)"], "head_matter": "Circuit Court, D. Pennsylvania.\n[2 Dall. 343;\nUNITED STATES v. STEWART.\n1\nSAME v. WRIGHT.\n1795.\nRawle (attorney for the district)\nThe prisoners being brought to the bar, on separate charges of high treason, Lewis read their depositions, stating the absence of material witnesses in both cases, and moved to postpone the trials \u2019till an opportunity was given, to procure the attendance of those witnesses from the western counties. He urged, the general inconveniency of a commitment and trial at so great a distance, from the scene of the criminal transaction; the friendless situation of the prisoners, and the poverty of the witnesses; and he alledged, that, under such circumstances, an immediate trial would be a mere ex parte proceeding. To shew the lenity with which persons thus charged have always been treated, he cited Post. Crown Law, 1, and to account for the delay in procuring the witnesses, he observed, that as the act of congress (1 Story\u2019s Laws, 63, \u00a7 29 [1 Stat 88]) declared, that \u201cin cases punishable with death, the trial shall be had in the county where the offence was committed,\u201d if it could be done without great inconvenience, the prisoners might reasonably have expected that indulgence, until the motion for a special conrt had been refused, on account of the peculiar difficulties of the case, in opposition to the general inclination of the judges. Nor could there be any preparation for trial \u2019till the charge was known, and the names of the witnesses who were to prove the indictments. By the practice under the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania (and the case is the same here) a defendant cannot have compulsory process to bring in his witnesses, before he has sworn that they are material; and he cannot so swear \u2019till he knows the charge and the witnesses that support it. It is essential to the administration of justice, and to the feelings of humanity, that the defendants should have time to investigate the characters of witnesses, and to bring proofs in contradiction to the accusation. Hence, even in England, where the counties are generally smaller than in this country, a period of ten days is allowed, between the time of furnishing lists of the witnesses and jurors, and the time of trial. 7 Anne, c. 21; 4 Bl. Comm. 345. And altho\u2019 the act of congress (1 Stat. 112, \u00a7 29) only says that copies of the indictment and a list of the jury and witnesses shall be delivered to the prisoner \u201cat least, three entire days before he shall be tried,\u201d yet it must certainly be the intention of the legislature to afford an opportunity to canvass the characters of the witnesses, or the provision would be nugatory: that opportunity cannot be deemed to commence \u2019till he knows their names, and it cannot be deemed to be compleat, unless he has had time to send for information to the places in which they reside. The court will, therefore, exercise a discretion as to the length of time to be allowed, in proportion to the distance; and, conformably to the ease in Post. Crown Law, 1, the time so allowed for preparation, will be subsequent to the delivery of the copy of the indictment, and the lists of witnesses.\npremised, that an acquiescence in the present motion, would, probably, put off the trial for the term. He urged, that the prisoners must long ago have known the nature of the charge, and the proofs necessary to their defence; and ought to have made an earlier application for the aid of the court to procure their witnesses. Due diligence has not been used, nor, indeed, is it so stated in the affidavits; and it is not only necessary to satisfy the court that the witnesses are material; but also that the party applying has been guilty of no laches, or neglect, in omitting to apply to them and endeav-ouring to procure their attendance. 3 Burrows, 1513. Ever since the 20th April, there has been an opportunity to make this motion; which was not the case in Post. Crown Law, 1, as that arose before a special court, acting under a special commission, for special purposes. Nor can there be a just reason to object to the trial's coming on, because of the place at -which the court is held. On the motion for a special court, sufficient was disclosed to shew, that the indictments would be presented in Philadelphia; and it was a mere speculation afterwards to suppose that another place would be appointed for the trials; particularly as all the jurors and witnesses had been actually summoned.\nCase No. 16,401.\nTrials for Treason-\u2014Time Allowed Defendant for Bringing Witnesses\u2014Right to Bail.\n[1.

GAUTIER.\n1795.\nBefore PATTERSON, Circuit Justice, and PETERS, District Judge.\nM. Levy, for plaintiff,\nMr. Du Ponceau, for defendant,\nA capias had issued in this suit, returnable to the present term; but previously to the return of the writ, there had been a hearing before Judge Peters, at his chambers, upon a citation to shew cause, why the defendant should not be discharged on common bail; the judge had ordered bail to be given; and the defendant had appealed from this order to the court. The merits of the appeal were now discussed; and, independent of some circumstances relating to the origin of the debt (which the court said ought not to weigh upon a question of bail -) the material facts appeared to be these: An action had been instituted in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, between the same parties, for the same cause; and on a hearing before Cnief Justice M\u2019Kean, the defendant was ordered to be discharged on common bail. From that order the plaintiff did not appeal; but afterwards applied by motion to the supreme court, for a rule upon the defendant to enter special bail. This the court refused; because they would not take cognizance of the subject, but by \u25a0way of appeal from the decision of the chief justice; and the proper time for making such au appeal had elapsed. Under these circumstances, the plaintiff discontinued his action in the state court, and brought the present, action here. It also appeared that the plaintiff (who was a foreigner, ignorant of our laws) had not originally employed an attorney to appear before Chief Justice M\u2019lvean, though the person that then attended him, pretended to have a competent knowledge of legal proceedings.\ncontended that bail ought to be given. Nothing short of a judgment, can be a perpetual bar in personal actions; and, therefore, the certificate of a discharge on common bail by the .chief justice of Pennsylvania, was not binding upon the judge of this court, who had given a different order. The person, character, and legal talents, of that judge could not be taken into view. The justices of the courts of common pleas possess a concurrent jurisdiction without possessing a spark of his jurisprudential knowledge; and yet if his discharge is conclusive, so likewise must theirs be.\n3\nActions are often commenced \u25a0after non-suits; and, it is clear, that the second court is not bound, in such cases, nor even in cases where a decision may have been had on the merits, by the opinion \u2022Of a first court. It is true, that every species of vexation should be discountenanced; but every mistake ought not to be interpreted Into an act of vexation. The plaintiff was ill-advised in the mode of presenting his case to the chief justice of Pennsyl-Tania; and, considering his ignorance of \u2022our laws, he ought not to lose the benefit of bail, by the laches of his agent, in not pursuing the technical form of an appeal. Nor is the discontinuance of the former action, under these circumstances, to be imputed to him as matter of malice and persecution. If the plaintiff\u2019s motive was originally just .and commendable, to recover a bona fide debt, the allegation of any subsequent impropriety must be manifested by some fact: now, if he was ever fairly entitled to hold the defendant to bail, the discharge can furnish no ground to accuse the plaintiff of vexation for endeavouring, by various means, to accomplish that object; and, after the state court had refused to interpose, he must either abandon that object, or discontinue his suit, and resort to another tribunal. A man may commence a suit as often as he pleases; and may hold his debt- or twenty different times to bail, if any reasonable cause can be assigned for so withdrawing and renewing the process of the law. No argument to the contrary can be founded on 2 Wils. 381; for bail was there refused on the second action, because it had not been asked in the first. Vexation must flow from a worse source than ignorance, or accident: it is generally instigated by malice; and always characterized by vigilance. In the present case, there is no symptom of malice; and the want of vigilance has alone produced the plaintiff\u2019s embarrassment.\nadmitted, that when a discontinuance took place, without any vexatious design or effect, either in consequence of a mistake in the nature of the action, or of an attorney\u2019s slip in the form of conducting it, bail might be ordered in the second action,' for the same cause; But he contended, that when a question has been decided by one tribunal, another tribunal of co-ordinate jurisdiction will not take cognizance of it, except in the regular course of a judicial appeal. He urged, likewise, that the circumstances of instituting and discontinuing an action in the state court, were prima facie evidence of vexation, that required a better explanation \u00bfnd excuse than have been given; and to these he added the change of the tribunal. But he particularly insisted, that the neglect of appealing from the order of Chief Justice M\u2019Kean, was his own laches, which he ought not to be allowed to remedy by transferring the suit to another court, at the expense of his antagonist. 2 Wils. 381.\nCase No. 10,709.\nBaii, \u2014 Action in Federal Court after Discontinuance in State Court \u2014 When Required.\n[1.
